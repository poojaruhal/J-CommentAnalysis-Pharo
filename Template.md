[ [ [ 
			"Write code snippet here"

			aCollection := OrderedCollection new:5.
] ] ]

!!Public API and their usage
; ApiOne
: description of #ApiOne 
  
; ApiTwo
: description of #ApiTwo   
 

!!Instance Variables
; edges <Object>
: description of edges

; nodes <Object>

] ] ]

!!Public API and their usage
; collectValues
: Collect values from the object and return a new collection.
 
 

!!Instance Variables
; edges <Object>
: edges connect two nodes.

; nodes <Object>
