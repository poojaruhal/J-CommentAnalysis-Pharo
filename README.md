# Code Comment Practices and Evolution: the Case of the Pharo Ecosystem

# Abstract

Code comments play a paramount role in program comprehension, development, and maintenance tasks.
    Given their unstructured (or semi-structured)  nature and varying quality,  
     researchers have analyzed characteristics of comments in different programming languages, to ensure a high quality of comments.
    However, no previous work has analyzed these characteristics in the Pharo program language,
    where commenting evolutionary patterns are not known and best practices are still forming.
