I am the superclass of TestCase and TestResource and can also be the superclass of any test helper classes you create to factor out test behaviour.  I exist so that test code can be refactored between my subclasses without difficulty.Send #assert:description: when you want to check for an expected value. For example, you might say	self assert: socket isOpen description: 'We requested a socket but now it is not open'.to test whether or not a socket is open at a point in a test.  Use description strings both to give more information about where a test failed in debugger notifiers and logs, and to document the intent of a test.

"TextAnchor","TextAnchors support anchoring of images in text.  A TextAnchor exists as an attribute of text emphasis, and it gets control like a FontReference, through the emphasizeScanner: message.  Depending on whether its anchoredMorph is a Morph or a Form, it repositions the morph, or displays the form respectively.  The coordination between composition, display and selection can best be understood by browsing the various implementations of placeEmbeddedObject:.In the morphic world, simply embed any form or morph in text.	Workspace new		contents: (Text withAll: 'foo') , (Text string: '*' attribute: (TextAnchor new anchoredMorph: MenuIcons confirmIcon)) , (Text withAll: 'bar');		openLabel: 'Text with Form'.	Workspace new		contents: (Text withAll: 'foo') , (Text string: '*' attribute: (TextAnchor new anchoredMorph: EllipseMorph new)) , (Text withAll: 'bar');		openLabel: 'Text with Morph'.In this case you select a piece of the screen, and it gets anchored to a one-character text in the editor's past buffer.

"ExternalSemaphoreTable","By John M McIntosh johnmci@smalltalkconsulting.comThis class was written to mange the external semaphore table. When I was writing a Socket test server I discovered various race conditions on the access to the externalSemaphore table. This new class uses class side methods to restrict access using two mutex semaphores, one for removal and one for additions to the table. It seemed cleaner to deligate the reponsibility here versus adding more code and another class variable to SystemDictionary Note that in Smalltalk recreateSpecialObjectsArray we still directly play with the table.Henrik Sperre JohansenThe name is somewhat of a misnomer; the table can be used for any objects, not just semaphores.That is its main usage though, so a split which deals with semaphores and other external objects differently (In the same underlying table) is not currently worth it.Therefore, while in general not all users will care if the table is above a certain size, we still guard  against adding more objects than the limit above which external signals would be lost (on some VMs.)"

Finally, note that newDepth: ends by executing a 'ControlManager restore' which currently terminates the active process, so nothing that follows in the doit will get executed.Depths 1, 2, 4 and 8 bits go through a color map to put color on the screen, but 16 and 32-bit color use the pixel values directly for RGB color (5 and 8 bits per, respectivlely).

"MultiByteFileStream","The central class to access the external file.

CrLfFileStream class>>new now returns an instance of MultiByteFileStream.  There are several pitfalls:  * You always have to be careful about the binary/text distinction.  In #text mode, it usually interpret the bytes.  * A few file pointer operations treat the file as uninterpreted byte no matter what.  This means that if you use 'fileStream skip: -1', 'fileStream position: x', etc. in #text mode, the file position can be in the middle of multi byte character.  If you want to implement some function similar to #peek for example, call the saveStateOf: and restoreStateOf: methods to be able to get back to the original state.  * #lineEndConvention: and #wantsLineEndConversion: (and #binary) can cause some puzzling situation because the inst var lineEndConvention and wantsLineEndConversion are mutated.

"LanguageEnvironment","The name multilingualized Squeak suggests that you can use multiple language at one time.  This is true, of course, but the system still how to manage the primary language; that provides the interpretation of data going out or coming in from outside world. It also provides how to render strings, as there rendering rule could be different in one language to another, even if the code points in a string is the same.  Originally, LanguageEnvironment and its subclasses only has class side methods.  After merged with Diego's Babel work, it now has instance side methods.  Since this historical reason, the class side and instance side are not related well.  When we talk about the interface with the outside of the Squeak world, there are three different ""channels""; the keyboard input, clipboard output and input, and filename.  On a not-to-uncommon system such as a Unix system localized to Japan, all of these three can have (and does have) different encodings.  So we need to manage them separately.  Note that the encoding in a file can be anything.  While it is nice to provide a suggested guess for this 'default system file content encoding', it is not critical.  Rendering support is limited basic L-to-R rendering so far.  But you can provide different line-wrap rule, at least."

"Character","I represent a character by storing its associated Unicode. The first 256 characters are created uniquely, so that all instances of latin1 characters ($R, for example) are identical.	The code point is based on Unicode.  Since Unicode is 21-bit wide character set, we have several bits available for other information.  As the Unicode Standard  states, a Unicode code point doesn't carry the language information.  This is going to be a problem with the languages so called CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean.  Or often CJKV including Vietnamese).  Since the characters of those languages are unified and given the same code point, it is impossible to display a bare Unicode code point in an inspector or such tools.  To utilize the extra available bits, we use them for identifying the languages.  Since the old implementation uses the bits to identify the character encoding, the bits are sometimes called ""encoding tag"" or neutrally ""leading char"", but the bits rigidly denotes the concept of languages.	The other languages can have the language tag if you like.  This will help to break the large default font (font set) into separately loadable chunk of fonts.  However, it is open to the each native speakers and writers to decide how to define the character equality, since the same Unicode code point may have different language tag thus simple #= comparison may return false.I represent a character by storing its associated ASCII code (extended to 256 codes).

When my load factor reaches this limit I replace my array with a larger one (see #grow) ensuring that my load factor will be less than or equal to 50%.

"BitBlt","I represent a block transfer (BLT) of pixels into a rectangle (destX, destY, width, height) of the destinationForm.  The source of pixels may be a similar rectangle (at sourceX, sourceY) in the sourceForm, or a constant color, currently called halftoneForm.  If both are specified, their pixel values are combined with a logical AND function prior to transfer.  In any case, the pixels from the source are combined with those of the destination by as specified by the combinationRule.The combination rule whose value is 0 through 15 programs the transfer to produce 1 or 0 according to its 4-bit representation as follows:	8:	if source is 0 and destination is 0	4:	if source is 0 and destination is 1	2:	if source is 1 and destination is 0	1:	if source is 1 and destination is 1.At each pixel the corresponding bits of the source and destination pixel values determine one of these conditions;  if the combination rule has a 1 in the corresponding bit position, then the new destination value will be 1, otherwise it will be zero.  Forms may be of different depths, see the comment in class Form.In addition to the original 16 combination rules, this BitBlt supports	16	fails (to simulate paint bits)	17	fails (to simulate erase bits)	18	sourceWord + destinationWord	19	sourceWord - destinationWord	20	rgbAdd: sourceWord with: destinationWord.

Wherever the sourceForm is non-zero, it replaces the destination.  Can be used with a 1-bit source color mapped to (0, FFFFFFFF), and a fillColor to fill the dest with that color wherever the source is 1.	26	pixMask: sourceWord with: destinationWord.

Min of each color component.	29	rgbMin: sourceWord bitInvert32 with: destinationWord.

Sum of abs of differences in components	33	tallyIntoMap: destinationWord.  Tallies pixValues into a colorMap	34	alphaBlendScaled: srcWord with: dstWord. Alpha blend of scaled srcWord and destWord.The color specified by halftoneForm may be either a Color or a Pattern.   A Color is converted to a pixelValue for the depth of the destinationForm.  If a Pattern, BitBlt will simply interpret its bitmap as an array of Color pixelValues.  BitBlt aligns the first element of this array with the top scanline of the destinationForm, the second with the second, and so on, cycling through the color array as necessary.  Within each scan line the 32-bit value is repeated from left to right across the form.  If the value repeats on pixels boudaries, the effect will be a constant color;  if not, it will produce a halftone that repeats on 32-bit boundaries.Any transfer specified is further clipped by the specified rectangle (clipX, clipY, clipWidth, clipHeight), and also by the bounds of the source and destination forms.	To make a small Form repeat and fill a big form, use an InfiniteForm as the source.	To write on a form and leave with both transparent and opapue areas, use a MaskedForm as the source.Pixels from a source to a destination whose pixels have a different depth are converted based on the optional colorMap.  If colorMap is nil, then conversion to more bits is done by filling the new high-order bits with zero, and conversion to fewer bits is done by truncating the lost high-order bits.  The colorMap, if specified, must be a either word array (ie Bitmap) with 2^n elements, where n is the pixel depth of the source, or a fully specified ColorMap which may contain a lookup table (ie Bitmap) and/or four separate masks and shifts which are applied to the pixels. For every source pixel, BitBlt will first perform masking and shifting and then index the lookup table, and select the corresponding pixelValue and mask it to the destination pixel size before storing.	When blitting from a 32 or 16 bit deep Form to one 8 bits or less, the default is truncation.  This will produce very strange colors, since truncation of the high bits does not produce the nearest encoded color.  Supply a 512 long colorMap, and red, green, and blue will be shifted down to 3 bits each, and mapped.  The message copybits...stdColors will use the best map to the standard colors for destinations of depths 8, 4, 2 and 1.  Two other sized of colorMaps are allowed, 4096 (4 bits per color) and 32786 (five bits per color).	Normal blits between 16 and 32 bit forms truncates or pads the colors automatically to provide the best preservation of colors.	Colors can be remapped at the same depth.  Sometimes a Form is in terms of colors that are not the standard colors for this depth, for example in a GIF file.  Convert the Form to a MaskedForm and send colorMap: the list of colors that the picture is in terms of.  MaskedForm will use the colorMap when copying to the display or another Form. (Note also that a Form can be copied to itself, and transformed in the process, if a non-nil colorMap is supplied.)"

"RenderBugz","A RenderBugz is an infinite recursion bug test for TransformationMorphs.In 3.9 (7067) and before, when TransformationMorph has no rendee there are several methods that will infinitely recurse until manually stopped or the image runs out of memory.So far the ones I've caught are the getters and setters for heading and forwardDirection.So there  are tests for them here.Ideally there would be a way to run a test against a stopwatch to catch endless recursion.Found it. Now incorperated. And the tests should be both save to run and cleanup after themselves even when they fail. So far we have not tested the normal cases of rendering working. I will leave that as a separate task for another time. So this is an automatic test when the bugs are fixed and interactive (crash) tests when the bugs are present.Instance VariablesRevision notes. wiz 5/15/2008 22:58When running tests from the TestRunner browser the test would sporadically fail.When they failed a transfomation morph would be left on the screen and not removed by the ensureBlock. So I changed things to fall under MorphicUIBugTests because that had a cleanup mechansizm for left over morphs.I also added one routine to test for time and one parameter to determine the time limit.To my surprise doubling or tripling the time limit still produced sporadic errors when the test is run repeatedly enough ( I am using a 400mz iMac. )  So now the parameter is set to 4. Things will probably fail there if tried long enough. At that point try 5 etc. I am reluctant to make the number larger than necessary. The tighter the test the more you know what is working.I also added a dummy test to check specifically for the timing bug. It fails on the same sporadic basis as the other test went the time parameter is short enough. This lends confidence to the theory that the timing difficulty is coming from outside the test. The sunit runner puts up a progress morph for each test. So the morphic display stuff is busy and probably also the GC."

(It doesn't necessarily have to be fixed for 3.0 if it looks messy, but if it's a simple fix, it would be worth it.)In Morphic, if you have the following text in a workspace:This is line 1This is line 2**and** you have a return character after line 2, you will normally be able to click the mouse two times below line 2 in order to select all the text.  If you edit line 2 (e.g. so that it reads ""line number 2""), you can still select all the text by clicking below the second line.  However, if you edit line 1, you will not be able to select all the text from the bottom in the same way.  Things get messed up such that the last return character seems to be gone.  In this state, if you position the cursor immediately after the 2, and press the right arrow, the cursor jumps to the beginning of line 2... oof. (report by Doug Way)While I don't have a very deep understanding of the above mentioned method, I was able to determine that text ending in a CR worked better in the editor when the last entry in <lines> had a start of text size + 1 and a stop of text size. I have accordingly added code near the end to ensure this. It seems to have fixed the problem, but we do need to clean this baby up some day. - Bob"

"URI","A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact string of characters for identifying an abstract or physical resource. This implementation is based on http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt.It should be probably updated to http://labs.apache.org/webarch/uri/rfc/rfc3986.htmlURI syntax=======The string based representation of a URI  has the following syntax [scheme:]scheme-specific-part[#fragment]where square brackets [...] represents optional parts and the characters : and # stand for themselves.Another definition given in the specification is   URI         = scheme "":"" hier-part [ ""?"" query ] [ ""#"" fragment ]   hier-part   = ""//"" authority path-abempty               / path-absolute               / path-rootless               / path-empty    foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose      \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/       |           |            |            |        |    scheme     authority       path        query   fragment       |   _____________________|__      / \ /                        \      urn:example:animal:ferret:noseAn absolute URI has a scheme; a URI that is not absolute is said to be relative. URIs are also classified according to whether they are opaque or hierarchical.An opaque URI is an absolute URI whose scheme-specific part does not begin with a slash character ('/'). Opaque URIs are not subject to further parsing. Some examples of opaque URIs are:	mailto:Pharo-project@lists.gforge.inria.fr	news:comp.lang.smalltalk		urn:isbn:000102002xA hierarchical URI is either an absolute URI whose scheme-specific part begins with a slash character, or a relative URI, that is, a URI that does not specify a scheme. Some examples of hierarchical URIs are:http://www.pharo-project.org/homefile:///~/calendarA hierarchical URI is subject to further parsing according to the syntax	[scheme:][//authority][path][?query][#fragment]where the characters :, /, ?, and # stand for themselves. The scheme-specific part of a hierarchical URI consists of the characters between the scheme and fragment parts.The authority part of a hierarchical URI is, if specified, either server-based or registry-based. A server-based authority parses according to the  syntax	[user-info@]host[:port]where the characters @ and : stand for themselves. Nearly all URI schemes currently in use are server-based. An authority part that does not parse in this way is considered to be registry-based.The path component of a hierarchical URI is itself said to be absolute if it begins with a slash character ('/'); otherwise it is relative. The path of a hierarchical URI that is either absolute or specifies an authority is always absolute.A URI instance has then the following nine components:	Part						Type	scheme					String	scheme-specific-part    	String	authority					String	user-info					String	host						String	port						Integer	path						String	query						String	fragment					StringDifference between URI, URL and URN=========================A URI is a uniform resource identifier while a URL is a uniform resource locator.  Every URL is a URI but not every URI is a URL. This is because there is another subcategory of URIs, uniform resource names (URNs), which name resources but do not specify how to locate them. The following expressions are URNs examples	mailto:Pharo-project@lists.gforge.inria.fr	news:comp.lang.smalltalk		urn:isbn:000102002x	"

"Exception","This is the main class used to implement the exception handling system (EHS).  It plays two distinct roles:  that of the exception, and that of the exception handler.

Instances should neither be created nor trapped.  In most cases, subclasses should inherit from Error or Notification rather than directly from Exception.Exceptions have an optional #messageText that can be set when they are signaled.Exceptions also have the concept of #signaler, the object that is the subject of the exception.This will be set automatically (to the #receiver), but can be set when the exception is signaled. In implementing this EHS, The Fourth Estate Inc. incorporated some ideas and code from Craig Latta's EHS.  His insights were crucial in allowing us to implement BlockContext>>valueUninterruptably (and by extension, #ensure: and #ifCurtailed:), and we imported the following methods with little or no modification:ContextPart>>terminateTo:ContextPart>>terminateMethodContext>>receiver:MethodContext>>answer:Thanks, Craig!"

VM refers only to WeakFinalizationList class. In this way, my class and its implementation can serve as an example for implementing various finalization actions, which may differ from this one, provided by default for use by weak registry.Once initialized, my instance should: - point to particular list (an instance of WeakFinalizationList), - next should be nil - executor or multiple executors initialized - weak reference slot should point to some object of interestAt the moment, when object, referenced weakly, become garbage, VM checks if its fist instance variable is an instance of WeakFinalizationList.If it so, then it adds a given object to this list, and also links the tail of list through 'next' instance variable. So, as a result of garbage collection, a list will contain all objects, which had weak references to garbage collected objects. It is a responsibility of application to manage the instances of WeakFinalizationList's , as well as clear this list before the next garbage collection.As a consequence of that you can: - use multiple different lists and manage them differently in order to react differently when some objects became garbage - you are not obliged to handle/clear the list(s) immediately after GC. You can clean up them periodically. - you can implement own kind of weak referencing object(s), which could use same finalization, provided by newer VMs.VM requires only that an object with weak reference having at least two instance variables,and its first instance variable points to instance of WeakFinalizationList.

Registering an interest in an event is called adding a dependant. Deregistering is called removing  a dependant.  The EventManager's action map is a WeakIdentityDictionary that maps events (selectors) to dependants (objects & selectors) in a way that ensures the mapping is to specific objects (hence identity) and in a way that allows the object to be garbage collected if not other used (hence weak.)

These options are mutually exclusive.The @ character can be combined with the name to match lists of items. If combined with the . character, then it will match a list of statement nodes (0 or more). If used without the . or # character, then it matches anything except for list of statements. Combining the @ with the # is not supported.Adding another ` in the name will cause the search/replace to look for more matches inside the node that this node matched.

Contrary to existing tools Gofer makes sure that these operations are performed as clean as possible:- Gofer treats packages from one or more repository in one operation.- Gofer works with fixed versions or tries to find the ""latest"" version using a given package name.- Gofer automatically assigns repositories to all packages, so that the other tools are ready to be used on individual packages.- Gofer makes sure that there is only one repository instance registered for a single physical location.- Gofer works with Monticello dependencies and uniformly treats them like the primary package.- Gofer prefers to work with faster repositories if there is a choice.- Gofer cleans up after Monticello, no empty class categories and no empty method protocols are to be expected.- Gofer supports operations to sync remote and local repositories with each other.! InstallationGofer is included with the latest Pharo and GemStone distributions. To update to the latest version you can use Gofer itself:== Gofer upgradeIn case you are missing Gofer in your image, grab it from *http://source.lukas-renggli.ch/gofer.html*.! DescriptionGofer is very simple by design, the basic useage scenario is always the same and consists of three steps:# You specify one or more Monticello repository URLs. You can do this using the methods ==url:==, ==url:username:password:== (HTTP, FTP), ==directory:==, or ==repository:== if you need full control. You might also use the convenience methods like ==squeaksource:==, ==wiresong:==, or ==gemsource:== for well known repositories. Additionally the following settings are available:#- Gofer implicitly declares the local package cache as a repository. To disable the local package cache use the method ==disablePackageCache==, to re-enable use ==enablePackageCache==.#- Gofer throws an error if a repository is not reachable. To silently ignore repository erros use the message ==disableRepositoryErrors==, to re-enable use ==enableRepositoryErrors==.# You specify one or more Monticello packages you want to work with, by adding them to the Gofer instance. Use ==version:== to add a specific version, or use ==package:== to add the ""latest"" version in the given repository. Furthermore there is ==package:constraint:== that allows you to further constraint the version to be loaded in a block passed in as the second argument.# You specify one or more actions to be performed on the specified packages:| ==load==	| Load the specified packages.| ==update==	| Update the specified packages.| ==merge==	| Merge the specified packages into their working copies.| ==localChanges==	| Answer the changes between the base version and the working copy.| ==browseLocalChanges==	| Browse the changes between the base version and the working copy.| ==remoteChanges==	| Answer the changes between the working copy and the remote changes.| ==browseRemoteChanges==	| Browse the changes between the working copy and the remote changes.| ==cleanup==	| Cleans the specified packages.| ==commit==	| Commit the modified specified packages.| ==commit:==	| Commit the modified specified packages with the given commit message.| ==revert==	| Revert the specified packages to the currently loaded version.| ==recompile==	| Recompile the specified packages.| ==reinitialize==	| Call the class side initializers on the specified packages.| ==unload==	| Unload the specified packages.| ==fetch==     | Download versions from remote repositories into the local cache.| ==push==      | Upload local versions from local cache into remote repositories.! ExampleTo use Gofer to update to exact versions of the Kom Server, the 'latest' code of Seaside 2.8 and the 'latest' code of the Scriptaculous package that is committed by the author with the initials 'lr' one could evaluate:== Gofer new==     squeaksource: 'KomHttpServer';==     version: 'DynamicBindings-gc.7';==     version: 'KomServices-gc.19';==     version: 'KomHttpServer-gc.32';==     update.== Gofer new==     squeaksource: 'Seaside';==     package: 'Seaside2.8a';==     package: 'Scriptaculous' constraint: [ :version | version author = 'lr' ];==     load"

The instance variable rwmode, inherited from class PositionableStream, here is used to hold a Boolean -- true means opened for read-write, false means opened for read-only.  2/12/96 swI implement a simple read buffering scheme with the variables defined in PositionableStream (which are unused in me otherwise) in the following way:	collection	<ByteString> or <ByteArray>	This is the buffer.	position	<Integer>	The relative position in the buffer. Greater or equal to zero.	readLimit	<Integer>	The number of bytes buffered. Greater or equal to zero.Read buffering is enabled with #enableReadBuffering, disabled with #disableReadBuffering and it is enabled by default. The buffer is filled when a read attempt of an unbuffered absolute position is requested, or when a negative repositioning is made (with #position: with an argument < than the current absolute position) to an absolute position which is not buffered. In the first case, the buffer is positioned to the given absolute position. In the latter case the repositioning is made to the requested absolute position minus fourth of the buffer size. This means that further small negative repositionings won't result in buffer flushing. This is really useful when filing in code.The read buffer is flushed (#flushReadBuffer) whenever a write attempt is made.The buffer state is valid if and only if collection is not nil and position < readLimit."

"TextMorph","TextMorphs support display of text with emphasis.  They also support reasonable text-editing capabilities, as well as embedded hot links, and the ability to embed submorphs in the text.Late in life, TextMorph was made a subclass of BorderedMorph to provide border and background color if desired.  In order to keep things compatible, protocols have been redirected so that color (preferably textColor) relates to the text, and backgroundColor relates to the inner fill color.Text display is clipped to the innerBounds of the rectangle, and text composition is normally performed within a rectangle which is innerBounds inset by the margins parameter.If text has been embedded in another object, one can elect to fill the owner's shape, in which case the text will be laid out in the shape of the owner's shadow image (including any submorphs other than the text).  One can also elect to have the text avoid occlusions, in which case it will avoid the bounds of any sibling morphs that appear in front of it.  It may be necessary to update bounds in order for the text runaround to notice the presence of a new occluding shape.The optional autoFitContents property enables the following feature:  if the text contents changes, then the bounds of the morph will be adjusted to fit the minimum rectangle that encloses the text (plus any margins specified).  Similarly, any attempt to change the size of the morph will be resisted if this parameter is set.  Except...If the wrapFlag parameter is true, then text will be wrapped at word boundaries based on the composition width (innerBounds insetBy: margins) width.  Thus an attempt to resize the morph in autofit mode, if it changes the width, will cause the text to be recomposed with the new width, and then the bounds will be reset to the minimum enclosing rectangle.  Similarly, if the text contents are changed with the wrapFlag set to true, word wrap will be performed based on the current compostion width, after which the bounds will be set (or not), based on the autoFitcontents property.Note that fonts can only be applied to the TextMorph as a whole.  While you can change the size, color, and emphasis of a subsection of the text and have it apply to only that subsection, changing the font changes the font for the entire contents of the TextMorph. Still a TextMorph can be composed of several texts of different fonts| font1 font2 t1 t2 tMorph|tMorph := TextMorph new.font1 := (TextFontReference toFont: (StrikeFont familyName: 'Atlanta' size: 22)).font2 := (TextFontReference toFont: (StrikeFont familyName: 'Atlanta' size: 11)).t1 := 'this is font1' asText addAttribute: font1.t2 := ' and this is font2' asText addAttribute: font2.tMorph contents: (t1,t2).tMorph openInHand.Yet to do:Make a comprehensive control for the eyedropper, with border width and color, inner color and text color, and margin widths."

"PluggableTabButtonMorph","This is a specialized pluggable button morph that is meant to represent a tab in a set of tabs arranged horizontally.  Each tab will overlap slightly when drawn.  All but one tab will be drawn in left to right order in the specified color, but lighter.  The active tab will be drawn last in the full color and slightly taller to indicate that it is selected.  Clicking the active tab has no effect but clicking any other tab will change the active tab to the clicked tab.This morph does not itself accept any events.  The parent tab set will grab the mouse clicks and handle notifying the appropriate tabs that they have been activated or deactivated.There is a single selector which provides the text for the button label and affects the width of the tab.  When the width changes the tab will inform its parent that it has changed and that the layout needs to be updated.  The model for the text selector of course should be the client for the tab set.The button label can be a String, Text, or Morph.  Texts work better than plain Strings."

The morphs owned by a morph are its submorphs. Morphs are drawn recursively; if a Morph has no owner it never gets drawn. To hide a Morph and its submorphs, set its #visible property to false using the #visible: method. The World (screen) coordinate system is used for most coordinates, but can be changed if there is a TransformMorph somewhere in the owner chain. My instance variables have accessor methods (e.g., #bounds, #bounds:). Most users should use the accessor methods instead of using the instance variables directly.Structure:instance var 	Type 			Description bounds 			Rectangle 		A Rectangle indicating my position and a size that will enclose 									me. owner 			Morph		 	My parent Morph, or nil for the top-level Morph, which is a 				or nil			world, typically a PasteUpMorph.submorphs 		Array 			My child Morphs. fullBounds 		Rectangle 		A Rectangle minimally enclosing me and my submorphs. color 			Color 			My primary color.

"ExpandedSourceFileArray","This is a variation on StandardSourceFileArray that provides a larger maximum changes file size.The available address space for source pointers in a traditional CompiledMethod is 16r1000000 through 16r4FFFFFF. StandardSourceFileArray maps positions in the sources file to address range 16r1000000 through 16r1FFFFFF and 16r3000000 through 16r3FFFFFF, and positions in the changes file to address range 16r2000000 through 16r2FFFFFF and 16r4000000 through 16r4FFFFFF. This permits a maximum file size of 16r2000000 (32MB) for both the sources file and the changes file. This implementation extends the source pointer address space using bit 25 of the source pointer to identify the external sources and changes files, with the remaining high order bits treated as address extension. This limits the number of external file references to two (the traditional sources and changes files). If additional external file references are needed in the future, some higher order bits in the source pointer address space should be allocated for that purpose.The use of bit 25 of the source pointer for file references permits backward compatibility with StandardSourceFileArray, with essentially unlimited address space expansion for the sources and changes files."

"MenuRegistration","A MenuRegistration stores the declaration of a menu item. It is mainly an handler for a PluggableMenuItemSpec. A menu item is declared withing a particular method tagged with a pragma. This kind-of method takes a builder as argument and its evaluation results in the building of a MenuRegistration sub-tree which is stored in the builder.   As an example:MenuRegistrationExample class>>myOwnCoolToolRegistrationOn: aBuilder 	<worldMenuExample> 	(aBuilder item: #MyOwnCoolTool)		label: 'My own cool tool';		target: Workspace; 		selector: #openContents: ;		arguments: #('yep, my own cool tool can be opened from the world menu ! :)')	Evaluating this method results in the creation of a MenuRegistration which name is #MyOwnCoolTool. Thus, the resulting sub-tree is only made of a root node. After it has be built, this root node is recorded in the builder. To experiment this, just evaluate the following code:-------------| builder |builder := PragmaMenuBuilder new.MenuRegistrationExample myOwnCoolToolRegistrationOn: builder.builder explore-------------Using pragma allows the menu builder to dynamically discover which are the methods to evaluate in order to build a menu. Thus, a resulting menu is built by evaluating a set of methods which share the same pragma keyword.In the following example, all method having <worldMenuExample> are evaluated for the building of the resulting menu:---------------(PragmaMenuBuilder pragmaKeyword: 'worldMenuExample' model: nil) menu popUpInWorld---------------Within a method, three kind of declarations can be used: (1) item by item (2) an item with a sub-menu and (3) a group.1 -  item by item menu registration declaration:This kind of declaring is for the setting of one menu item and only one within a method.1.1 -  A simple menu item with an actionIn the following example, a menu item with the name #'Browser' and a action which consists in sending #openClassBrowser to StandardToolSet is declared:AClassSomewhere class>>openBrowserOn: aBuilder	<myMenuTest>	(aBuilder item: #'Browser') 		target: StandardToolSet; 		selector: #openClassBrowser.A simple action without any argument can also be set with a block:	(aBuilder item: #'Browser') action: [StandardToolSet openClassBrowser]You can also indicate a balloon help string and a particular icon:	(aBuilder item: #'Browser') 		action: [StandardToolSet openClassBrowser];		help: 'Open a system browser';		icon: MenuIcons smallSystemBrowserIconIf the action needs one or several arguments, you can also give it/them as follow:	(aBuilder item: #'Save and quit') 		target: SmalltalkImage current; 		selector: #snapshot:andQuit:.		arguments: #(true true)		By default, the item label is set with the item name but it can be explicitly given as follow:	(aBuilder item: #'Browser')		label: 'System browser'; 		target: StandardToolSet; 		selector: #openClassBrowser.1.2  -  Placing the menu item in a  menuThe resulting menu item of previous example will be placed at the root of the menu.In order to declare another place for it, you have to explicitly set its parent name.As an example, consider the following item which declares a simple entry with no action.Such item is typically used as a root for a sub-menu tree:AClassSomewhere class>>openToolsOn: aBuilder	<myMenuTest>	(aBuilder item: #'Tools')Now, a sub-menu item for #Tools can be declared separately, within another methodby using the #parent: message:AnotherClassSomewhere class>>myToolsOn: aBuilder	<myMenuTest>	(aBuilder item: #'CoolTool')		label: 'Cool tool';		parent: #Tools;Note that the argument of #parent: must be the name of another item. If it is not the case, then the parent name indication is simply ignored.1.3  -  Item orderingIf no ordering setting is indicated, items ordering is unpredicable (it depends on method retrieving order). If one want an item to appear at a certain position, it is possible to set it by sending #order: to a MenuRegistration. The #order: message takes a float as argument. As an example, see  the two following declarations, in the resulting menu, Wozy is placed before 'Wozy configuration'AnotherClassSomewhere class>>myWozySystemOpenOn: aBuilder	<myMenuTest>	(aBuilder item: #'Wozy')		parent: #CoolTool;		order: 1.0		AnotherClassSomewhere class>>myWozySystemConfigOn: aBuilder	<myMenuTest>	(aBuilder item: #'Wozy configuration')		parent: #CoolTool;		order: 2.02) Item with a submenuThe one menu item - one declaring method way can be ugly. When a set a menu items are known to be put all-together, it is possible to declare the sub-tree in one method. The following example show such a sub-tree with the #Tools item at root and four sub-items declared in a single method. Note a menu target declared for the root is shared by all sub-items. In that case, it also remains possible for a sub-item to declare its own target.AClassSomewhere class>>openToolsOn: aBuilder	<myMenuTest>	(aBuilder item: #'Tools')		target:  StandardToolSet; ""The target is shared by all children""		with: [ ""My sub-menu are given here""			(aBuilder item: #'System browser') selector: #openClassBrowser.			(aBuilder item: #Workspace) selector: #openWorkspace.			(aBuilder item: #'Test Runner') selector: #openTestRunner.			(aBuilder item: #'Monticello Browser') selector: #openMonticelloBrowser]		3) group of menu itemsWhen you want some items to be shown always grouped together, you can use a group. Its declaring is like an item with a submenu except that you are using the message #group: instead of #item:. The consequence is that only the children are shown in the menu. Of course, #label and #icon: are ignored for a group. Here is an example:AClassSomewhere class>>mostUsedToolsOn: aBuilder	<myMenuTest>	(aBuilder group: #MostUsedTools) ""My name can be also used as parent name""		withSeparatorAfter; ""A separator will be added after my last child""		order: 0; ""the entire group will be placed at the top""		target:  StandardToolSet; ""The target is shared by all children""		with: [			(aBuilder item: #'System browser') selector: #openClassBrowser.			(aBuilder item: #Workspace) selector: #openWorkspace.			(aBuilder item: #'Test Runner') selector: #openTestRunner.			(aBuilder item: #'Monticello Browser') selector: #openMonticelloBrowser]---------------------------		Instance Variables	isGroup:		<Boolean>	itemList:		<SortedCollection>	order:		<Number>	owner:		<MenuRegistration>	parentName:		<Symbol>	spec:		<PluggableMenuItemSpec>isGroup	- if true, then this item is ignored and flattenitemList	- all my MenuRegistration (my sub-menus or my elements if i'm a group)order	- my order in the owner listowner	- my ownerparentName	- the declared parent name which serve as basis for PragmaBenuBuilder>>#arrangeRegistrationsspec	- my PluggableMenuItemSpec"

"DeepCopier","DeepCopier does a veryDeepCopy.  It is a complete tree copy using a dictionary.  Any object that is in the tree twice is only copied once.  All references to the object in the copy of the tree will point to the new copy.  See Object|veryDeepCopy which calls (self veryDeepCopyWith: aDeepCopier).When a tree of morphs points at a morph outside of itself, that morph should not be copied.  Use our own kind of weak pointers for the 'potentially outside' morphs.   Default is that any new class will have all of its fields deeply copied.  If a field needs to be weakly copied, define veryDeepInner: and veryDeepFixupWith:.     veryDeepInner: has the loop that actually copies the fields.  If a class defines its own copy of veryDeepInner: (to leave some fields out), then veryDeepFixupWith: will be called on that object at the end.  veryDeepInner: can compute an alternate object to put in a field.  (Object veryDeepCopyWith: discovers which superclasses did not define veryDeepInner:, and very deeply copies the variables defined in those classes).	To decide if a class needs veryDeepInner: and veryDeepFixupWith:, ask this about an instance:  If I duplicate this object, does that mean that I also want to make duplicates of the things it holds onto?  If yes, (i.e. a Paragraph does want a new copy of its Text) then do nothing.  If no, (i.e. an undo command does not want to copy the objects it acts upon), then define veryDeepInner: and veryDeepFixupWith:.	Here is an analysis for the specific case of a morph being held by another morph.  Does field X contain a morph (or a Player whose costume is a morph)?  If not, no action needed.Is the morph in field X already a submorph of the object?  Is it down lower in the submorph tree?	If so, no action needed.Could the morph in field X every appear on the screen (be a submorph of some other morph)?	If not, no action needed.	If it could, you must write the methods veryDeepFixupWith:   and   veryDeepInner:, and in them, refrain from sending veryDeepCopyWith: to the contents of field X.----- Things Ted is still considering -----Rule:  If a morph stores a uniClass class (Player 57) as an object in a field, the new uniClass will not be stored there.   Each uniClass instance does have a new class created for it.  (fix this by putting the old class in references and allow lookup?  Wrong if encounter it before seeing an instance?)Rule: If object A has object C in a field, and A says (^ C) for the copy, but object B has A in a normal field and it gets deepCopied, and A in encountered first, then there will be two copies of C.  (just be aware of it)Dependents are now fixed up.  Suppose a model has a dependent view.  In the DependentFields dictionary, model -> (view ...).  	If only the model is copied, no dependents are created (no one knows about the new model).  	If only the view is copied, it is inserted into DependentFields on the right side.  model -> (view  copiedView ...).  	If both are copied, the new model has the new view as its dependent.	If additional things depend on a model that is copied, the caller must add them to its dependents."

"TableLayout","The layout process:For computing the new layout for the children of any morph, we start with an initial rectangle which is provided as a reference.Step 1: The first step of layout computation is to compute the minimum extent each of our children can have. The minimum extent is mapped through both the local layout frame of the morph (for relative positioning) and the global layout frame (for insets, such as cursor indication) to obtain the minimal size required for each cell.Step 2: Based on the cell sizes, the number of cells we can put into each row and column is computed. For equal spacing, the maximum size of the cells is taken into account here.Step 3: Based on the row/column sizes, we compute the extra space which should be added to each row/column. For 	#leftFlush/#topFlush - we add all extra space add the end	#rightFlush/#bottomFlush - we add all extra space at the start	#centering - we add 1/2 of the extra space at start and end	#justified - we distribute the space evenly between the morphs[NOTE: If any #spaceFill morphs are encountered during this step, #justified is implied and the space is exclusively and equally distributed between those #spaceFill morphs. This is for backward compatibility and should *never* be necessary in the new regime].Step 4: The morphs are placed in the computed cells and the extra space is distributed as necessary.

"ChangeSet","ChangeSets keep track of the changes made to a system, so they can be written on a file as source code (a ""fileOut""). This implementation of ChangeSet is capable of remembering and manipulating methods for which the classes are not present in the system.  However at the present time, this capability is not used in normal rearranging and fileOuts, but only for invoking and revoking associated with isolation layers.For isolated projects (see Project class comment), the changeSet binding is semi-permanent.  Every project exists in an isolation layer defined by its closest enclosing parent (or itself) that is isolated.  If a project is not isolated, then changes reported to its designated changeSet must also be reported to the permanent changeSet for that layer, designated in the isolated project.  This ensures that that outer project will be able to revert all changes upon exit.Note that only certain changes may be reverted.  Classes may not be added, removed, renamed or reshaped except in the layer in which they are defined because these operations on non-local classes are not revertable.If a Squeak Project is established as being isolated, then its associated changeSet will be declared to be revertable.  In this case all changes stored can be reverted.

Later we can tell how it changed and write a conversion method.  The conversion method is used when old format objects are brought in from the disk from ImageSegment files (.extSeg) or SmartRefStream files (.obj .morph .bo .sp).NOTE:  It should be fairly simple, by adding a bit more information to the classChangeRecords, to reconstruct the information now stored in 'structures' and 'superclasses'.

"PragmaMenuBuilder","For the impatients, see MenuRegistrationExample class methods and try it with:---------------((PragmaMenuBuilder pragmaKeyword: MenuRegistrationExample pragmaKeyword model: nil) menuEntitled: 'World') popUpInWorld---------------PragmaMenuBuilder is for the dynamic building of menus based on pragmas. A PragmaMenuBuilder instance is the root of a tree of MenuRegistration instances.The basic principle is that each menu sub-tree is specified by a method which is tagged by a specific pragma. Such methods are dynamically retrieved and then evaluated with a MenuRegistration passed as argument (see #retrieveRegistrations). The result is a tree of MenuRegistration which roots are stored in my itemList inst. var.After the tree of MenuRegistration has been built, it is re-organized (re-organization is based on the parent declaration) and is re-ordered (based on the MenuRegistration order indications). Then the tree of MenuRegistration can serve as input for the building of a PluggableMenuSpec. The PluggableMenuSpec is itself used in order to build a MenuMorph with the help of the current ToolBuilder. (see MenuRegistration comment for more informations about how to specify menu entries).The tree of MenuRegistration is built by #buildTree in three steps (1) the  collecting of the MenuRegistration instances (2) the re-organization and (3) the sorting:1) The first step consists in evaluating all pragma methods by passing a builder (a PragmaMenuBuilder instance) as argument. Each pragma method invocation build a sub-tree which root is added to the builder itemList collection. (see #collectRegistrations).As an example, this first step could produce a tree as follow (stored in a PragmaMenuBuilder itemList inst var) :				#Tools						#'Other tool', parentName: #Tools				/	\										|	(#Worspace)	(#browser)						(#'Test runner' )2) The second step consists is re-organizing the tree. A MenuRegistration can be declared with a particular parent name (by sending #parent: to it with a symbol as argument). If the parentName of a MenuRegistration X is the name of another MenuRegistration Z, then it means that X must be placed as a child of Z. This is the goal of this re-arrangement step which moves badly placed nodes at their good place. (see #arrangeRegistrations).With previous example, the second step produces:						#Tools												/		|			\	(#Worspace)	(#browser)		#'Other tool' , parentName: #Tools											|									(#'Test runner')2) The third step consists in sorting the tree according to the order inst. var. value of each MenuRegistration. This is done in two passes: the first pass tries to assign as much order inst. var. as possible (If an item is given with a specific order, then, previous and following items order can be automatically computed - see #assignOrderWithBlock: and #orderAssignBlock). The second pass consists in a smple sort according to a sort block given by #itemSortBlock.Instance Variables	model:		<Object>	pragmaCollector:		<PragmaCollection>	pragmaKeywords:		<Collection of Symbol>	currentRoot: 			<MenuRegistration>model	- Serves as the default target for the menu. Note that a default target can also be declared at menu item levelpragmaKeywords	- The list of pragma keywords used for the declaring of my menu itemspragmaCollector	- The PragmaCollector associated with this builder. When a method declared with the same pragma as my pragmaKeyword is updated/added/removed my menu items are recomputed so that the resulting menu is always in sync with currently declared items.	currentRoot	- the current MenuRegistration in which new items are to be added"

Basicly it provides a scalable thumbnail with the usual morph event behaviors.A menu item allows for ""photographing"" any morph on the screen to become the subject of our images.Instance Variables	imagePopupMorph:		<anImageMorph>	image: 					<aForm>	desiredExtent			<aPoint>	isPopup					<aBool>imagePopupMorph	- an ImageMorph containing the full sized image.	- it can be set from a morph image via the sight target menu item.image	- holds the scaled thumbnail form of our imagePopupMorph image.desiredExtent	- holds the desired extent that the thumbnail is expected to fit within.	- it is guarded to be positive and non-zero.	- it can be set by extent: so that the yellow halo handle works.isPopup	- true when popup feature is on.	- toggled from red halo menu		Setting the size of the thumbnail works somewhat excentrically because the extent of the thumbnail depends both on the desiredExtent and the aspect ratio of the current popup image. With the popup feature off this morph can be picked up and dropped with the mouse.When the feature is on, a full sized snapshot will be seen when the mouse is pressed.Since the mouse can't be used for two things at once, moving the morph must be done with the grab halo or brown move halo."

"Beeper","Beeper provides simple audio (or in some other way) feedback to the user.The recommended use is ""Beeper beep"" to give the user the equivalence of a beep. If you want to force the beep to use the primitive in the VM for beeping, then use ""Beeper beepPrimitive"". In either case, if sounds are disabled there will be no beep.The actual beeping, when you use ""Beeper beep"", is done by sending a #play message to a registered playable object. You can register your own playable object by invoking the class side method #setDefault: passing in an object that responds to the #play message.The default playable object is an instance of Beeper itself which implements #play on the instance side. That implementation delegates the playing of the beep to the default SoundService.Note that #play is introduced as a common interface between AbstractSound and Beeper.This way we can register instances of AbstractSound as playable entities, for example:	Beeper setDefault: (SampledSound new						setSamples: self coffeeCupClink						samplingRate: 12000).Then ""Beeper beep"" will play the coffeeCup sound."

For example, if getStateSelector is nil, then this button shows the state of a read-only boolean that is always false.The model informs its view(s) of changes by sending #changed: to itself with getStateSelector as a parameter. The view tells the model when the button is pressed by sending actionSelector.If the actionSelector takes one or more arguments, then the following are relevant:		arguments			A list of arguments to provide when the actionSelector is called.		argumentsProvider	The object that is sent the argumentSelector to obtain arguments, if dynamic		argumentsSelector	The message sent to the argumentProvider to obtain the arguments.Options:	askBeforeChanging		have model ask user before allowing a change that could lose edits	triggerOnMouseDown	do this button's action on mouse down (vs. up) transition	shortcutCharacter		a place to record an optional shortcut key"

"DigitalSignatureAlgorithm","This class implements the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) of the U.S. government's ""Digital Signature Standard"" (DSS). The DSA algorithm was proposed in 1991 and became a standard in May 1994. The official description is available as a Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB 186, May 19, 1994). A companion standard, the Secure Hash Standard, or SHS (FIPS PUB 180-1, April 17, 1995), describes a 160-bit message digest algorithm known as the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). This message digest is used to compute the document signature.Here's how to use it:  1. The ""signer"" creates a pair of keys. One of these must be kept private. The other may be freely distributed. For example, it could be built into the signature checking code of an application.  2. When the signer wishes to sign a packet of data (a ""message"") , he uses the secure hash algorithm to create a 160-bit message digest (hash) which is used as the input to DSA. The result of this is a pair of large numbers called a ""signature"" that is attached to the original message.  3. When someone receives a signed message purported to have come from the signer, they compute the 160-bit hash of the message and pass that, along with the message signature and the signer's public key, to the signature verification algorithm. If the signature checks, then it is virtually guaranteed that the message originated from someone who had the signer's private key. That is, the message is not a forgery and has not been modified since it was signed. For example, if the message contains a program, and the recipient trusts the signer, then the recipient can run the program with the assurance that it won't do anything harmful. (At least, not intentionally. A digital signature is no guarantee against bugs! :->)The signer must keep the private key secure, since anyone who has the private key can forge the signer's signature on any message they like. As long as the secret key is not stolen, cryptographers believe it to be virtually impossible either to forge a signature, to find a message that matches an existing sigature, or to discover the signer's private key by analyzing message signatures. Knowing the public key (which, for example, could be recovered from an application that had it built in), does not weaken the security at all.An excellent reference work on digital signatures and cryptography in general is:  Schneier, Bruce  ""Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C""  John Wiley and Sons, 1996.I used this book as a guide to implementing many of the numerical algorithms required by DSA.Patents and Export Restrictions:Many digital signature technologies are patented. DSA is also patented, but the patent is owned by the U.S. government which has made DSA available royalty-free. There is a claim that the government patent infringes on an earlier patent by Schnorr, but the government is requiring the use of DSA, so they apparently believe this claim is not strong enough to be a serious threat to their own patent.Most cryptography technology, including digital signature technology, requires an export license for it to be distributed outside the U.S. Recent legislation may have relaxed the export license requirements, but it would be prudent to check the current regulations before exporting this code."

Characters are mapped to glyphs by using the characterToGyphMap.Subclasses can have non-trivial mapping rules as well as different representations for glyphs sizes (e.g., not using an xTable). If so, these classes should return nil when queried for xTable and/or the characterToGlyphMap.

The interrupted call stack is then examined for caller information. See below for an example showing different settings* tallySends: and friends use the interpreter simulator to run the block, recording every method call.The two give you different results:	* spyOn: gives you a view of where the time is being spent in your program, at least on a rough statistical level (assuming you've run the 	block for long enough and have a high enough poll rate). If you're trying to optimize your code, start here and optimize the methods where 	most of the time is being spent first.	* tallySends: gives you accurate counts of how many times methods get called, and by exactly which route. If you're debugging, or trying to 	figure out if a given method is getting called too many times, this is your tool.Q: How do you interpret MessageTally>>tallySendsA: The methods #tallySends and #spyOn: measure two very different quantities, but broken down in the same who-called-who format.  #spyOn: is approximate, but more indicative of real time spent, whereas #tallySends is exact and a precise record of how many times each method got executed.Examples----------Here you can see all the processes computation time			[1000 timesRepeat: [3.14159 printString.

"MaybeContextInstanceVariableNode","This class conspires to arrange that inst var access for contexts is done exclusively using the long-form instance variabl;e access bytecodes.  See InstructionStream class>>variablesAndOffsetsDo:.A virtual machine can benefit in performance by organizing method and block activations using a  more conventional stack organization than by using first-class activation records (contexts).  But such a virtual machine is also cabable of hiding the stack and making it appear as if contexts are still used.  This means the system has better performance but still has all the benefits of first-class activation records.  To pull this off the VM needs to intercept any and all accesses to context objects so that it can make contexts function as proxy objects for stack frames.Without help from the image such a virtual machine based on an interpreter would have to perform an expensive check on all instance variable accesses to determine if the instance variable was that of a context serving as a proxy for a stack frame.  A simple hack is to take advantage of the short and long forms of instance variable access bytecodes.  The BlueBook instruction set (and likely any bytecode set evolved from it) has short form bytecodes for fetching and storing the first few bytecodes (BlueBook fetch first 16, store first 8).  Contexts typically have at most 6 instance variables.  If we arrange to use the long-form bytecodes for all context inst var accesses then we only have to check for context inst var access in long-form bytecodes, and then only if the index is within the context inst var range.  This effectively makes the check free because on modern processors checking an index fetched from memory into a register against a constant costs far less than the memry read to fetch the index."

"Matrix","I represent a two-dimensional array, rather like Array2D.There are three main differences between me and Array2D:(1) Array2D inherits from ArrayedCollection, but isn't one.  A lot of things that should work    do not work in consequence of this.(2) Array2D uses ""at: column at: row"" index order, which means that nothing you write using    it is likely to work either.  I use the almost universal ""at: row at: column"" order, so it is    much easier to adapt code from other languages without going doolally.(3) Array2D lets you specify the class of the underlying collection, I don't.Structure:  nrows : a non-negative integer saying how many rows there are.  ncols : a non-negative integer saying how many columns there are.  contents : an Array holding the elements in row-major order.  That is, for a 2x3 array    the contents are (11 12 13 21 22 23).  Array2D uses column major order.    You can specify the class of 'contents' when you create a new Array2D,    but Matrix always gives you an Array.    There is a reason for this.  In strongly typed languages like Haskell and Clean,    'unboxed arrays' save you both space AND time.  But in Squeak, while    WordArray and FloatArray and so on do save space, it costs time to use them.    A LOT of time.  I've measured aFloatArray sum running nearly twice as slow as    anArray sum.  The reason is that whenever you fetch an element from an Array,    that's all that happens, but when you fetch an element from aFloatArray, a whole    new Float gets allocated to hold the value.  This takes time and churns memory.    So the paradox is that if you want fast numerical stuff, DON'T use unboxed arrays!    Another reason for always insisting on an Array is that letting it be something    else would make things like #, and #,, rather more complicated.  Always using Array    is the simplest thing that could possibly work, and it works rather well.I was trying to patch Array2D to make more things work, but just couldn't get my headaround the subscript order.  That's why I made Matrix.Element-wise matrix arithmetic works; you can freely mix matrices and numbers butdon't try to mix matrices and arrays (yet).Matrix multiplication, using the symbol +* (derived from APL's +.x), works between(Matrix or Array) +* (Matrix or Array).  Don't try to use a number as an argument of +*.Matrix * Number and Number * Matrix work fine, so you don't need +* with numbers.Still to come: oodles of stuff.  Gaussian elimination maybe, other stuff probably not."

"Number","Class Number holds the most general methods for dealing with numbers. Subclasses Float, Fraction, and Integer, and their subclasses, provide concrete representations of a numeric quantity.All of Number's subclasses participate in a simple type coercion mechanism that supports mixed-mode arithmetic and comparisons.  It works as follows:  If	self<typeA> op: arg<typeB>fails because of incompatible types, then it is retried in the following guise:	(arg adaptTypeA: self) op: arg adaptToTypeA.This gives the arg of typeB an opportunity to resolve the incompatibility, knowing exactly what two types are involved.  If self is more general, then arg will be converted, and viceVersa.  This mechanism is extensible to any new number classes that one might wish to add to Squeak.  The only requirement is that every subclass of Number must support a pair of conversion methods specific to each of the other subclasses of Number.Implementation notes----------------------------------The implementation of #degreeCos and #degreeSin is such that results are exact for any multiple of 90.Care is also taken to evaluate the sine between -90¬∞ and 90¬∞, this will avoid #degreesToRadians and i386 FPU sine fonction to accumulate round off errors due to approximate representation of pi.We can thus evaluate 240 degreeCos with at most 1 ulp error. It's not perfect, but better than previous implementation.For cosine, we know that:	cosd(x)=cosd(abs(x))	cosd(x)=sind(90-x)thus the trick is to evaluate:	cosd(x)=sind(90-abs(x)) after appropriate modulo in [-180,180[This way, we are sure to evaluate the sine between -90¬∞ and 90¬∞The #degreesToRadians and #sin are used rather than #degreeSin to avoid cycles.For sine, it would be necessary to evaluate eithersind(x) if abs(x) <=90or sind(180-x) if abs(x) >= 90A possible implementation would be:	| x |	x := 90 + self \\ 360 - 90.	x >= 180 ifTrue: [x := 180 - x].	^x degreesToRadians sinWe prefer evaluating cosd(90-x) thus providing a branch free implementation."

"Monitor","A monitor provides process synchronization that is more high level than the one provided by a Semaphore. Similar to the classical definition of a Monitor it has the following properties:1) At any time, only one process can execute code inside a critical section of a monitor.2) A monitor is reentrant, which means that the active process in a monitor never gets blocked when it enters a (nested) critical section of the same monitor.3) Inside a critical section, a process can wait for an event that may be coupled to a certain condition. If the condition is not fulfilled, the process leaves the monitor temporarily (in order to let other processes enter) and waits until another process signals the event. Then, the original process checks the condition again (this is often necessary because the state of the monitor could have changed in the meantime) and continues if it is fulfilled.4) The monitor is fair, which means that the process that is waiting on a signaled condition the longest gets activated first.5) The monitor allows you to define timeouts after which a process gets activated automatically.Basic usage:Monitor>>critical: aBlockCritical section.Executes aBlock as a critical section. At any time, only one process can execute code in a critical section.NOTE: All the following synchronization operations are only valid inside the critical section of the monitor!Monitor>>waitUnconditional waiting for the default event.The current process gets blocked and leaves the monitor, which means that the monitor allows another process to execute critical code. When the default event is signaled, the original process is resumed.Monitor>>waitWhile: aBlockConditional waiting for the default event.The current process gets blocked and leaves the monitor only if the argument block evaluates to true. This means that another process can enter the monitor. When the default event is signaled, the original process is resumed, which means that the condition (argument block) is checked again. Only if it evaluates to false, does execution proceed. Otherwise, the process gets blocked and leaves the monitor again...Monitor>>waitUntil: aBlockConditional waiting for the default event.See Monitor>>waitWhile: aBlock.Monitor>>signalOne process waiting for the default event is woken up.Monitor>>signalAllAll processes waiting for the default event are woken up.Using non-default (specific) events:Monitor>>waitFor: aSymbolUnconditional waiting for the non-default event represented by the argument symbol.Same as Monitor>>wait, but the process gets only reactivated by the specific event and not the default event.Monitor>>waitWhile: aBlock for: aSymbolConfitional waiting for the non-default event represented by the argument symbol.Same as Monitor>>waitWhile:for:, but the process gets only reactivated by the specific event and not the default event.Monitor>>waitUntil: aBlock for: aSymbolConfitional waiting for the non-default event represented by the argument symbol.See Monitor>>waitWhile:for: aBlock.Monitor>>signal: aSymbolOne process waiting for the given event is woken up.

The tree is made up of subsequent tables storing all entries at the current bit depth. Each entry in the table (e.g., a 32bit Integer value) is either a leaf or a non-leaf node. Leaf nodes store the immediate value in its low 16 bits whereas non-leaf nodes store the offset of the subtable in its low 16bits. The high 8 bits of non-leaf nodes contain the number of additional bits needed for the sub table (the high 8 bits of leaf-nodes are always zero). The first entry in each table is always a non-leaf node indicating how many bits we need to fetch initially. We can thus travel down the tree as follows (written in sort-of-pseudocode the actual implementation can be seen in InflateStream>>decodeValueFrom:):	table := initialTable.	bitsNeeded := high 8 bits of (table at: 1).		""Determine initial bits""	table := initialTable + (low 16 bits of (table at: 1)). ""Determine start of first real table""	[bits := fetch next bitsNeeded bits.

A sound system is registered in the application registry SoundService and can be accessed by ""SoundService default"" like for example:SoundService default playSoundNamed: 'croak'The idea is that as much sound playing as possible should go through this facade. This way we decouple the sound system from the rest of Squeak and make it pluggable. It also is a perfect spot to check for the SoundSettings class>>soundEnabledTwo basic subclasses exist at the time of this writing, the BaseSoundSystem which represents the standard Squeak sound system, and the DummySoundSystem which is a dummy implementation that can be used when there is no sound card available, or when the base sound system isn't in the image, or when you simply don't want to use the available sound card."
"ExpandedSourceFileArrayTest","This test documents the source pointer address conversion methods for ExpandedSourceFileArray.The available address space for source pointers in a traditional CompiledMethod is 16r1000000 through 16r4FFFFFF. StandardSourceFileArray maps positions in the sources file to address range 16r1000000 through 16r1FFFFFF and 16r3000000 through 16r3FFFFFF, and positions in the changes file to address range 16r2000000 through 16r2FFFFFF and 16r4000000 through 16r4FFFFFF. This permits a maximum file size of 16r2000000 (32MB) for both the sources file and the changes file. ExpandedSourceFileArray extends the source pointer address space using bit 25 of the source pointer to identify the external sources and changes files, with the remaining high order bits treated as address extension. This limits the number of external file references to two (the traditional sources and changes files). If additional external file references are needed in the future, some higher order bits in the source pointer address space should be allocated for that purpose.The use of bit 25 of the source pointer for file references permits backward compatibility with StandardSourceFileArray, with essentially unlimited address space expansion for the sources and changes files."

"SocketStream","SocketStream is a wrapper for class Socket making it easy to write networking code by giving the programmer a stream-like protocol. A Socket is a two way communication link with two logically separate channels - input and output. The Socket class is the lowest level in Pharo for network communication and using it directly can be difficult and bug prone.A SocketStream can be in binary or ascii mode, ascii is the default which means you are transmitting and receiving Strings. Most Internet protocols are in clear text ascii, like for example HTTP. Another setting is what timeout you want to use - default is the standardTimeout from Socket. More settings can be found in the method category 'configuration'.Simplest example of connecting, sending/receiving and closing:| stream result |stream := SocketStream openConnectionToHostNamed: 'www.pharo-project.org' port: 80.[[stream nextPutAll: 'GET / HTTP/1.0'; crlf; crlf; flush.result := stream upToEnd. ""Give us all data until the socket is closed.""Transcript show: result; cr.]	ensure: [stream close]]		on: ConnectionTimedOut		do: [:ex | Transcript show: ex asString;cr. ex resume]There are two important things to note above:	- The methods in category ""stream in"" can signal two exceptions (unless turned off with #shouldSignal:):		ConnectionClosed and ConnectionTimedOut	- We close the stream using #ensure:, that is to make sure it isn't left opened.	- We use #on:do: to catch any signal. In this case we do not need to catch ConnectionClosed since #upToEnd does that for us intrinsically.----------------SocketStream (below called SS) is a reimplementation of 'Old'-SocketStream (below called OSS) - the class that originates from the original Comanche implementation but now is included in standard Squeak. SS has the same protocol as OSS and is meant to replace it. SS is faster, more flexible, is better documented and adds a few features:1. #shouldSignal:, which decides if SS should signal low level Socket exceptions (true) or if it should swallow them like original OSS did. Default is true. The only reason I added this is for backwards compatibility - not signalling causes problems - see bug 4 below.2. #nextAllInBuffer, #nextInBuffer:, #skip:, #receiveData:, #nextPutAllFlush: and #recentlyRead are new additions to the public protocol.It also fixes various bugs:1. #isDataAvailable could theoretically answer false, when there actually is some in the buffer in OSS. If #receiveDataIfAvailable reads the last byte then the following ""socket dataAvailable"" would answer false. So the last byte would be sitting in the inStream missed.2. #upToAll: in OSS has several problems, for example - #positionOfSubCollection:ifAbsent: which was introduced answers one position too low. This was compensated in upToAll:, but only in the pushBack: call, not the actual result being returned which was cut short 1 byte. Amusingly this makes KomHttpServer not use ""Keep-Alive"" since the last $e in 'Alive' was cut short. :)3. SS doesn't inherit from PositionableStream since that just breaks various inherited messages, like for example #skip:. OSS should IMHO be changed to inherit from Object - or of course, replaced in full with SS. :)4. Since SocketStream by default signals closes and timeouts the SocketStreamTest now passes. The reason for SocketStream to fail is that while it does timeout on a low level (#SocketStream>>receiveData doesn't hang forever) - the callers of #receiveData sometimes loop - like in #next:, and thus eliminates the timeout. SS warns about some methods (in their method comments) not honouring timeouts if shouldSignal is false, I really don't know what they should do in that case:	#next:, #upTo:, #upToAll: and #upToEnd (and #receiveData:)The primary reason for the SS implementation is optimal performance. The main differences in implementation with the old OSS are:1. SS uses two buffers directly (inBuffer and outBuffer) with pointers marking start and stop within the buffer. OSS instead uses two regular streams, a ReadStream and a WriteStream. Using internal buffers makes it possible to avoid copying and reallocation in various ways, it also makes SS be able to have specialized growing/buffer moving behaviour.2. #upTo:, #upToAll: and #peekForAll: uses selectged String messages that in turn uses fast primitives for searching. OSS used other messages that fell back on byte per byte reading.3. #receiveData in OSS creates a temporary buffer stream for each call! During a long read operation, like say #upToAll: (which for example is used when uploading files using HTTP POST forms), this is devastating - especially since the default size is only 2000 bytes - and leads to a very high number of low level read operations on the Socket, typically 100 times more calls than with OSS. The buffer in OSS is held in an instvar (not recreated for each call), is larger from the start and above all - grows dynamically by doubling. OSS can also avoid a grow/reallocation by doing a ""move down"" if data has been read from the SS as it comes in and through that making room in the lower part of the inBuffer. The net result is that upToAll: for large files is about 10 times faster.4. The implementation of upTo: and upToAll: tries to avoid doing unnecessary find operations in the buffer and is greedy by default, which means it favors reading more data - if available - before searching for the stop sequence. If we had #findString:startingAt:stoppingAt: this wouldn't have to be greedy and we wouldn't be needlessly scanning dead buffer area. VM hackers? Also, while you are at it - make it work for ByteArrays too. :)SS can not be run unbuffered, since that seems unneeded. The option to autoFlush is still available, with it set to true SocketStream (just like OSS) will flush on its own on each nextPut:/nextPutAll:, otherwise flushing it will have to be done manually but is done on close.The first performance tests shows that, as noted above, receiving large amounts of data using #upToAll: is greatly improved - factor of 10. Serving HTTP with small payloads seemed at first not be faster at all - but this is due to the high overhead of Socket connect/close and other things. Increasing payloads show a difference and especially with keep alive on - where the new SS roughly doubles the throughput!"

"TextStopConditions","A TextStopConditions is a private helper class for text composition (See class CharacterScanner and subclasses).It maps some characters controling the text layout (like carriage return, line feeds, space and tabulation) to some selector representing the action to be performed by the CharacterScanner.By default, a TextStopConditions does not map any action to control character; instances must be properly initialized by sending #at:put: messages.For example, inter-word spacing can be adjusted so as to obtain ""justified"" paragraphs. See implementors of #paddedSpace, #cr, #space, #columnBreak for example of special character actions.A TextStopConditions also store two selectors for mapping the actions to be taken when:- end of run is encountered;- text overflows horizontal composition bounds.These actions are by default #endOfRun and #crossedX (see implementors of these messages), but can enventually be changed using #endOfRun: and #crossedX:.In a text (see class Text), the ""runs"" are used to store text style attributes, so an ""end of run"" event probably means some action in the textcomposer should be taken to change the font.TextStopConditions current implementation can only map 256 character codes (from 1 to 256). It is the composer responsibility to encode the character before sending #at:. Presumably, the composer will use the character codePoint + 1 (see implementors of #codePoint).If this is not sufficient, then this class could be changed to use a Dictionary or a LargeTableHistorically, the EndOfRun and CrossedX were two TextConstant of value 257 and 258, which did occupy corresponding slots in the stops array. Since these are valid character codePoint, this usage has been deprecated. However, because any error in text composition would have catastrophic consequences (unresponsive user interface), backward compatibility with obsolete historical code is still maintained internally which is why the stops array has a sze of 258.Instance Variables	crossedX:		<Symbol | nil>	endOfRun:		<Symbol | nil>	stops:		<Array of: Symbol | nil>crossedX	- selector to perform when the composed text overflows X composition boundendOfRun	- selector to perform at end of runstops	- an array mapping character code (codePoint + 1) to special actions, or nil if character is to be rendered normally"

"ColorForm","ColorForm is a normal Form plus a color map of up to 2^depth Colors. Typically, one reserves one entry in the color map for transparent. This allows 1, 3, 15, or 255 non-transparent colors in ColorForms of depths 1, 2, 4, and 8 bits per pixel. ColorForms don't support depths greater than 8 bits because that would require excessively large color maps with little real benefit, since 16-bit and 32-bit depths already support thousands and millions of colors.ColorForms have several uses:  1) Precise colors. You can have up to 256 true colors, instead being limited to the 8-bit color palette.  2) Easy transparency. Just store (Color transparent) at the desired position in the color map.  3) Cheap color remapping by changing the color map.A color map is an Array of up to 2^depth Color objects. A Bitmap colorMap is automatically computed and cached for rapid display. Note that if you change the color map, you must resubmit it via the colors: method to flush this cache.ColorForms can be a bit tricky. Note that:  a) When you BitBlt from one ColorForm to another, you must remember to copy the color map of the source ColorForm to the destination ColorForm.  b) A ColorForm's color map is an array of depth-independent Color objects. BitBlt requires a BitMap of actual pixel values, adjusted to the destination depth. These are different things! ColorForms automatically maintain a cache of the BitBlt-style color map corresponding to the colors array for the last depth on which the ColorForm was displayed, so there should be little need for clients to work with BitBlt-style color maps.  c) The default map for 8 bit depth has black in the first entry, not transparent.  Say (cform colors at: 1 put: Color transparent)."

(It doesn't necessarily have to be fixed for 3.0 if it looks messy, but if it's a simple fix, it would be worth it.)In Morphic, if you have the following text in a workspace:This is line 1This is line 2**and** you have a return character after line 2, you will normally be able to click the mouse two times below line 2 in order to select all the text.  If you edit line 2 (e.g. so that it reads ""line number 2""), you can still select all the text by clicking below the second line.  However, if you edit line 1, you will not be able to select all the text from the bottom in the same way.  Things get messed up such that the last return character seems to be gone.  In this state, if you position the cursor immediately after the 2, and press the right arrow, the cursor jumps to the beginning of line 2... oof. (report by Doug Way)While I don't have a very deep understanding of the above mentioned method, I was able to determine that text ending in a CR worked better in the editor when the last entry in <lines> had a start of text size + 1 and a stop of text size. I have accordingly added code near the end to ensure this. It seems to have fixed the problem, but we do need to clean this baby up some day. - Bob"

Instead of choosing one or the other, you can call ""MailSender default"" (where MailSender is a subclass of AppRegistry), and thus avoid creating a hard-coded dependency on either of the two mail senders.This will only really be useful, of course, for applications that have a very simple, general, well-defined interface. Most of the time, you're probably better off just marking your package as being dependent on a specific other package, and avoiding the hassle of this whole AppRegistry thing.

This is great for teaching about numbers, but may be confusing to the average reader:	3r20.2 --> 6.66666666666667	8r20.2 --> 16.25If you don't have access to the definition of IEEE-754, you can figure out what is going on by printing various simple values in Float hex.  It may help you to know that the basic format is...	sign		1 bit	exponent	11 bits with bias of 1023 (16r3FF) to produce an exponent						in the range -1023 .. +1024				- 16r000:					significand = 0: Float zero					significand ~= 0: Denormalized number (exp = -1024, no hidden '1' bit)				- 16r7FF:					significand = 0: Infinity					significand ~= 0: Not A Number (NaN) representation	mantissa	53 bits, but only 52 are stored (20 in the first word, 32 in the second).  This is because a normalized mantissa, by definition, has a 1 to the right of its floating point, and IEEE-754 omits this redundant bit to gain an extra bit of precision instead.  People talk about the mantissa without its leading one as the FRACTION, and with its leading 1 as the SIGNFICAND.The single-precision format is...	sign		1 bit	exponent	8 bits, with bias of 127, to represent -126 to +127                    - 0x0 and 0xFF reserved for Float zero (mantissa is ignored)                    - 16r7F reserved for Float underflow/overflow (mantissa is ignored)	mantissa	24 bits, but only 23 are storedThis format is used in FloatArray (qv), and much can be learned from the conversion routines, Float asIEEE32BitWord, and Float class fromIEEE32Bit:.Thanks to Rich Harmon for asking many questions and to Tim Olson, Bruce Cohen, Rick Zaccone and others for the answers that I have collected here."

The idea is that this collection represents the  input given by a user on a command line format.For example if the  user passes the following : #(a1 a2.txt -option1 arg1 arg2 arg3.txt -option2 arg4 -option3 arg5.avi -option4),this class offers different ways to access these arguments. The strings are accessible either by options or by file types.For example: 1. By option: allArgumentsAtOption: aSymbol	#* -> #(a1 a2.txt)	#option1 -> #(arg1 arg2 arg3.txt)	#option2 -> #(arg4)	#option3 -> #(arg5.avi)	#option4 -> #()	2. By file type:allFilesTyped: aSymbol	#txt -> #(a2.txt arg3.txt)	#avi -> #(arg5.avi)	Take a look to the method comments.Class side:----------------It is possible to register things to do to the class. These things will be done when the dispatch message will be thrown.To register a new extension and its associated action, you should change 	register: actionBlock if: conditionBlock name: aString.The argument of name is the name of the registration and it should be unique. All the conditionBlocks will be evaluated, and the ones returning true will get their corresponding actionBlock evaluated.Here is an example: 	register: [ :o | Transcript show: o allParameters ] if: [ :o | o allParameters isEmpty not ] name: #demoAs you can see, the blocks take a parameter. It is an instance of the class on which the block is registered.Note that you can use the dumpRegistrations and dumpRegistrationsInTranscript messages to know what is registered on the class or to know the name of a registration ou want to delete (with the message removeRegistrationNamed: aString)."

"MorphicModel","MorphicModels are used to represent structures with state and behavior as well as graphical structure.  A morphicModel is usually the root of a morphic tree depicting its appearance.  The tree is constructed concretely by adding its consituent morphs to a world.When a part is named in a world, it is given a new slot in the model.  When a part is sensitized, it is named, and a set of mouse-driven methods is also generated in the model.  These may be edited to induce particular behavior.  When a variable is added through the morphic world, it is given a slot in the model, along with a set of access methods.In addition for public variables (and this is the default for now), methods are generated and called in any outer model in which this model gets embedded, thus propagating variable changes outward."

"SettingBrowser","<help>! The User interfaceA SettingBrowser allows the browsing as well as the editing of setting values.For each setting, a label and an input widget allowing the change of the setting value are shown.!! Browsing standards settingsIn order to open a setting browser one can also use the expression below:--------------------SettingBrowser open--------------------It opens a SettingBrowser for all settings declared with the standard 'systemsettings' pragma keyword. To see how these settings are declared in the image, you can browse all senders of #systemsettings:--------------SystemNavigation new  browseAllCallsOn: #systemsettings--------------!! Browsing application specific settingsFor specific applications, other pragma keywords can be used. These keywords can be passed as follow:--------------------(SettingBrowser forKeywords: #('blob')) open.--------------------Then, only settings which are declared with the keyword 'blob' are viewed. Here is an example of such a setting declared in the class side of a class BlobSettings --------------------BlobSettings class>>blobSettingOn: aBuilder	<blob>	(aBuilder group: #blobEditing) 		label: 'Editing' translated;		parent: #blobBrowsing; 		description: 'All settings concerned with blob editing' translated;		with: [				(aBuilder setting: #color)	...--------------------The expression 'SettingBrowser open' is then equivalent to the '(SettingBrowser forKeywords: #('systemsettings')) open' expression.!! FilteringThe SettingBrowser has a filtering functionality to limitate the number of settings. You can enter a token in the input field of the toolbar in order to show only settings that are matching the token.Two filtering modes are allowed:  with a substring or with a regular expression.- with a substring: only settings which name, description, pragma class or method selector includes this substring are viewed; - with a regular expression: the same as with a substring except that the input is used as a regular expression. This filtering is applied if the Regexp checkbox is checked.! How to declare a settingA setting is declared with a method class side. This kind of method takes a builder as argument and a standard setting is tagged with the <systemsettings> pragma. The builder argument serves as a facade for the declaration.!!A simple boolean setting exampleLet's start with a setting declaration example:CodeHolderSystemSettings class>>caseSensitiveFindsSettingsOn: aBuilder	<systemsettings>	(aBuilder setting: #caseSensitiveFinds) 		label: 'Case sensitive search' translated;		description: 'If true, then the ""find"" command in text will always make its searches in a case-sensitive fashion' translated;		setSelector: #caseSensitiveFinds:;		getSelector: #caseSensitiveFinds;		target: TextEditor;		parent: #codeEditing.For this setting to be declared, we make the asumption that we have TextEditor class>>caseSensitiveFinds and TextEditor class>>caseSensitiveFinds: methods in order to change the preference value. To declare a setting, just send #setting: to the builder with its identifier, a Symbol passed as argument. It creates a setting node. Then you can set the label, the description with #label: and #description sent to the newly created setting node. You also have to set the selectors for setting and getting the preference value as well as the target to which these accessors are sent  (often a class). This is done by sending respectively, #setSelector:, #getSelector: and #target: to the setting node.Because all settings are organized in trees we need a way to indicate what is the position of the setting node in the overall setting trees list. In fact it can be done two ways. The first way is to use the #parent: message (A second possibility is to declare a subtree in one method, it is explained later in this documentation).The #parent: message is send for non root settings. #parent takes the identifier of the parent setting as argument.You may notice that in this example,  if we don't take into account the $: at the end of the setting accessor, the getting and the setting accessors are the same. This is often the case. You can simply set the setter and the getter by sending the #selector: message to the setting node. Thus the declaration is simplified as follow:CodeHolderSystemSettings class>>caseSensitiveFindsSettingsOn: aBuilder	<systemsettings>	(aBuilder setting: #caseSensitiveFinds) 		label: 'Case sensitive search' translated;		description: 'If true, then the ""find"" command in text will always make its searches in a case-sensitive fashion' translated;		selector: #caseSensitiveFinds;		target: TextEditor;		parent: #codeEditing.You may also notice that the identifier of the setting is then the same as the selector. In this case, you can omit to set the selector because by default, the identifier is used as the selector for getting the preference value and the identifier concatenated with a $: at the end is used as the setting selector. Thus the declaration is simplified again as follow:CodeHolderSystemSettings class>>caseSensitiveFindsSettingsOn: aBuilder	<systemsettings>	(aBuilder setting: #caseSensitiveFinds) 		label: 'Case sensitive search' translated;		description: 'If true, then the ""find"" command in text will always make its searches in a case-sensitive fashion' translated;		target: TextEditor;		parent: #codeEditing.Finally, if you decide to declare a setting directly in the class which implements the selector, the target information can be also omitted because the class in which the setting is declared is used by default. Thus the simplest declaration can be:TextEditor class>>caseSensitiveFindsSettingsOn: aBuilder	<systemsettings>	(aBuilder setting: #caseSensitiveFinds) 		label: 'Case sensitive search' translated;		description: 'If true, then the ""find"" command in text will always make its searches in a case-sensitive fashion' translated;		parent: #codeEditing.!!Declaring a subtree in one single methodDirectly declaring a sub-tree of settings in one method is also possible. Then, typically, a root group is declared for the application settings and the children settings themselves are also declared within the same method as in the example below in which #formatCommentWithStatements and #indentString are directly declared as children of the #configurableFormatter setting:RBConfigurableFormatter class>>settingsOn: aBuilder	<systemsettings>		(aBuilder group: #configurableFormatter)		target: self;		parent: #refactoring;		label: 'Configurable Formatter' translated;		description: 'Settings related to the formatter' translated;		with: [			(aBuilder setting: #formatCommentWithStatements)				label: 'Format comment with statements' translated.			(aBuilder setting: #indentString)				label: 'Indent string' translated]!!Optional settingAny setting can have children. In the case where a boolean setting is used as a parent, then, its children are chown only if the parent preference value is true.!!Range settingYou send the #range: message to the builder instead of the #setting: message. In addition, you send the #range: message to the setting with an interval as argument in order to indicate the valid range.screenMarginSettingOn: aBuilder	<systemsettings>	(aBuilder range: #fullscreenMargin)		target: SystemWindow;		parent: #windows;		label: 'Fullscreen margin' translated;		description: 'Specify the amount of space that is let around a windows when it''s opened fullscreen' translated;		range: (-5 to: 100).!!List settingFor this kind of setting, the SettingBrowser will show a drop list. Here is an example for the window position strategy. Notice that the setting is declared by sending the #pickOne message to the builder. Notice also that the list of valid values are given by sending the #domainValues: message to the setting. The argument is an array of association. Each association key is the label that is shown and the corresponding association value gives the value that will be assigned to the preference.windowPositionStrategySettingsOn: aBuilder	<systemsettings>	(aBuilder pickOne: #usedStrategy) 		label: 'Window position strategy' translated;		target: RealEstateAgent;		domainValues: {			'Reverse Stagger' translated -> #staggerFor:initialExtent:world:. 			'Cascade' translated -> #cascadeFor:initialExtent:world:. 			'Standard' translated -> #standardFor:initialExtent:world:};!!LauncherA launcher is a particular setting. It allows to launch a script directly from the setting browser. Imagine that you have changed some settings and that you need to evaluate a script in order to update some other objets. It can be used also to configurate globally a package of the entire image.As an example, in order to use True Type Fonts, the system must be updated by collecting all the available TT fonts. This can be done by evaluating the following expression:-------------FreeTypeFontProvider current updateFromSystem-------------In order to be able to launch this script from the setting browser, you have to declare a launcher. For example, look-at how the script for the TT fonts is declared in GraphicFontSettings class >> #standardFontsSettingsOn:.GraphicFontSettings class >> #standardFontsSettingsOn:	<systemsettings>	(aBuilder group: #standardFonts)		...		(aBuilder launcher: #updateFromSystem)				order: 1; 				target: FreeTypeFontProvider;				targetSelector: #current;				description: 'Update available fonts by scanning the current system';				script: #updateFromSystem;				label: 'Update fonts from system' translated.Notice that you send #launcher: to the builder in order to create the setting node, then you send #script: to the created node with the selector of the script passed as argument.</help>Implementation detailsSee also SettingNode, SettingTree, SettingNodeBuilder and SettingTreeBuilder classes.Instance Variables	roots:		<Collection of SettingTreeNode>	searchedText:		<String>	status:		<WriteStream>	collector:		<SettingCollector>roots	- the roots of the viewed setting treessearchedText	- the string used as a filter token or regexp in order to select viewed settingsstatus	- a WriteStream used in order to store useful information which are shown when no current item is selectedcollector	- The SettingCollector which has the responsibility to collect settings and to build viewed trees"

"Color","This class represents abstract color, regardless of the depth of bitmap it will be shown in.  At the very last moment a Color is converted to a pixelValue that depends on the depth of the actual Bitmap inside the Form it will be used with.  The supported depths (in bits) are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.  The number of actual colors at these depths are: 2, 4, 16, 256, 32768, and 16 million.  (See comment in BitBlt.)  To change the depth of the Display and set how many colors you can see, execute: (Display newDepth: 8).  (See comment in DisplayMedium)	Color is represented as the amount of light in red, green, and blue.  White is (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) and black is (0, 0, 0).  Pure red is (1.0, 0, 0).  These colors are ""additive"".  Think of Color's instance variables as:	r	amount of red, a Float between 0.0 and 1.0.	g	amount of green, a Float between 0.0 and 1.0.	b	amount of blue, a Float between 0.0 and 1.0.(But, in fact, the three are encoded as values from 0 to 1023 and combined in a single integer, rgb.  The user does not need to know this.)	Many colors are named.  You find a color by name by sending a message to class Color, for example (Color lightBlue).  Also, (Color red: 0.2 green: 0.6 blue: 1.0) or (Color r: 0.2 g: 0.6 b: 1.0) creates a color. (see below)	A color is essentially immutable.  Once you set red, green, and blue, you cannot change them.  Instead, create a new Color and use it.	Applications such as contour maps and bar graphs will want to display one of a set of shades based on a number.  Convert the range of this number to an integer from 1 to N.  Then call (Color green lightShades: N) to get an Array of colors from white to green.  Use the Array messages at:, atPin:, or atWrap: to pull out the correct color from the array.  atPin: gives the first (or last) color if the index is out of range.  atWrap: wraps around to the other end if the index is out of range.	Here are some fun things to run in when your screen has color:		Pen new mandala: 30 diameter: Display height-100.		Pen new web  ""Draw with the mouse, opt-click to end""		Display fillWhite.

"FastInflateStream","This class adds the following optimizations to the basic Inflate decompression:a) Bit reversed accessIf we want to fetch the bits efficiently then we have them in the wrong bit order (e.g., when we should fetch 2r100 we would get 2r001). But since the huffman tree lookup determines the efficiency of the decompression, reversing the bits before traversal is expensive. Therefore the entries in each table are stored in REVERSE BIT ORDER. This is achieved by a reverse increment of the current table index in the huffman table construction phase (see method increment:bits:). According to my measures this speeds up the implementation by about 30-40%.b) Inplace storage of code meanings and extra bitsRather than looking up the meaning for each code during decompression of blocks we store the appropriate values directly in the huffman tables, using a pre-defined mapping. Even though this does not make a big difference in speed, it cleans up the code and allows easier translation into primitive code (which is clearly one goal of this implementation).c) Precomputed huffman tables for fixed blocksSo we don't have to compute the huffman tables from scratch. The precomputed tables are not in our superclass to avoid double storage (and my superclass is more intended for documentation anyways)."

"DiskProxy","A DiskProxy is an externalized form of an object to write on aDataStream. It contains a ""constructor"" message to regeneratethe object, in context, when sent a comeFullyUpOnReload message(i.e. ""internalize"").We are now using DiskProxy for shared system objects like StrikeFonts.The idea is to define, for each kind of object that needs specialexternalization, a class method that will internalize the object byreconstructing it from its defining state. We call this a""constructor"" method. Then externalize such an object as a frozenmessage that invokes this method--a DiskProxy.(Here is the old comment:Constructing a new object is good for any object that (1) can not beexternalized simply by snapshotting and reloading its instancevariables (like a CompiledMethod or a Picture), or (2) wants to befree to evolve its internal representation without making storedinstances obsolete (and dangerous). Snapshotting and reloading anobject""s instance variables is a dangerous breach of encapsulation.The internal structure of the class is then free to evolve. Allexternalized instances will be useful as long as theconstructor methods are maintained with the same semantics.There may be several constructor methods for a particular class. Thisis useful for (1) instances with characteristically differentdefining state, and (2) newer, evolved forms of an object and itsconstructors, with the old constructor methods kept around so olddata can still be properly loaded.)Create one like this example from class Picture    DiskProxy global: #Picture            selector: #fromByteArray:                args: (Array with: self storage asByteArray)* See also subclass DiskProxyQ that will construct an object inthe above manner and then send it a sequence of messages. This may savecreating a wide variety of constructor methods. It is also useful becausethe newly read-in DiskProxyQ can catch messages like #objectContainedIn:(via #doesNotUnderstand:) and add them to the queue of messages tosend to the new object.* We may also want a subclass of DiskProxy that evaluates a stringexpression to compute the receiver of the constructor message.My instance variables:* globalObjectName -- the Symbol name of a global object in the    System dictionary (usually a class).* constructorSelector -- the constructor message selector Symbol to    send to the global object (perform:withArguments:), typically a    variation on newFrom:.* constructorArgs -- the Array of arguments to pass in the    constructor message.-- 11/9/92 Jerry Morrison"

In this  case, the following will happen:                                                                          1. FreeType looks for a bitmap for the glyph corresponding to the     face's current size.  If one is found, the function returns.  The     bitmap data can be accessed from the glyph slot (see note below).                                                                          2. If no embedded bitmap is searched or found, FreeType looks for a     scalable outline.  If one is found, it is loaded from the font     file, scaled to device pixels, then ""hinted"" to the pixel grid in     order to optimize it.  The outline data can be accessed from the     glyph slot (see note below).                                                                          Note that by default, the glyph loader doesn't render outlines into  bitmaps.  The following flags are used to modify this default  behaviour to more specific and useful cases.                                                                        FT_LOAD_NO_SCALE ::  Don't scale the vector outline being loaded to 26.6 fractional  pixels, but kept in font units.  Note that this also disables  hinting and the loading of embedded bitmaps.  You should only use it  when you want to retrieve the original glyph outlines in font units.                                                                        FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING ::  Don't hint glyph outlines after their scaling to device pixels.  This generally generates ""blurrier"" glyphs in anti-aliased modes.                                                                          This flag is ignored if @FT_LOAD_NO_SCALE is set.                                                                        FT_LOAD_RENDER ::  Render the glyph outline immediately into a bitmap before the glyph  loader returns.  By default, the glyph is rendered for the  @FT_RENDER_MODE_NORMAL mode, which corresponds to 8-bit anti-aliased  bitmaps using 256 opacity levels.  You can use either  @FT_LOAD_TARGET_MONO or @FT_LOAD_MONOCHROME to render 1-bit  monochrome bitmaps.                                                                          This flag is ignored if @FT_LOAD_NO_SCALE is set.                                                                        FT_LOAD_NO_BITMAP ::  Don't look for bitmaps when loading the glyph.  Only scalable  outlines will be loaded when available, and scaled, hinted, or  rendered depending on other bit flags.                                                                          This does not prevent you from rendering outlines to bitmaps  with @FT_LOAD_RENDER, however.                                                                        FT_LOAD_VERTICAL_LAYOUT ::  Prepare the glyph image for vertical text layout.  This basically  means that `face.glyph.advance' will correspond to the vertical  advance height (instead of the default horizontal advance width),  and that the glyph image will be translated to match the vertical  bearings positions.                                                                        FT_LOAD_FORCE_AUTOHINT ::  Force the use of the FreeType auto-hinter when a glyph outline is  loaded.  You shouldn't need this in a typical application, since it  is mostly used to experiment with its algorithm.                                                                        FT_LOAD_CROP_BITMAP ::  Indicates that the glyph loader should try to crop the bitmap (i.e.,  remove all space around its black bits) when loading it.  This is  only useful when loading embedded bitmaps in certain fonts, since  bitmaps rendered with @FT_LOAD_RENDER are always cropped by default.                                                                        FT_LOAD_PEDANTIC ::  Indicates that the glyph loader should perform pedantic  verifications during glyph loading, rejecting invalid fonts.  This  is mostly used to detect broken glyphs in fonts.  By default,  FreeType tries to handle broken fonts also.                                                                        FT_LOAD_IGNORE_GLOBAL_ADVANCE_WIDTH ::  Indicates that the glyph loader should ignore the global advance  width defined in the font.  As far as we know, this is only used by  the X-TrueType font server, in order to deal correctly with the  incorrect metrics contained in DynaLab's TrueType CJK fonts.                                                                        FT_LOAD_NO_RECURSE ::  This flag is only used internally.  It merely indicates that the  glyph loader should not load composite glyphs recursively.  Instead,  it should set the `num_subglyph' and `subglyphs' values of the glyph  slot accordingly, and set ""glyph->format"" to  @FT_GLYPH_FORMAT_COMPOSITE.                                                                          The description of sub-glyphs is not available to client  applications for now.                                                                        FT_LOAD_IGNORE_TRANSFORM ::  Indicates that the glyph loader should not try to transform the  loaded glyph image.  This doesn't prevent scaling, hinting, or  rendering.                                                                        FT_LOAD_MONOCHROME ::  This flag is used with @FT_LOAD_RENDER to indicate that you want  to render a 1-bit monochrome glyph bitmap from a vectorial outline.                                                                          Note that this has no effect on the hinting algorithm used by the  glyph loader.  You should better use @FT_LOAD_TARGET_MONO if you  want to render monochrome-optimized glyph images instead.                                                                        FT_LOAD_LINEAR_DESIGN ::  Return the linearly scaled metrics expressed in original font units  instead of the default 16.16 pixel values.                                                                        FT_LOAD_NO_AUTOHINT ::  Indicates that the auto-hinter should never be used to hint glyph  outlines.  This doesn't prevent native format-specific hinters from  being used.  This can be important for certain fonts where unhinted  output is better than auto-hinted one.One of following flags (as LoadTargetXXX) can be used to further specify the result.   FT_RENDER_MODE_NORMAL ::                                               This is the default render mode; it corresponds to 8-bit             anti-aliased bitmaps, using 256 levels of opacity.                                                                                      FT_RENDER_MODE_LIGHT ::                                                This is similar to @FT_RENDER_MODE_NORMAL, except that this          changes the hinting to prevent stem width quantization.  This        results in glyph shapes that are more similar to the original,       while being a bit more fuzzy (""better shapes"", instead of            ""better contrast"" if you want :-).                                                                                                      FT_RENDER_MODE_MONO ::                                                 This mode corresponds to 1-bit bitmaps.                                                                                                 FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD ::                                                  This mode corresponds to horizontal RGB/BGR sub-pixel displays,      like LCD-screens.  It produces 8-bit bitmaps that are 3 times        the width of the original glyph outline in pixels, and which use     the @FT_PIXEL_MODE_LCD mode.                                                                                                            FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD_V ::                                                This mode corresponds to vertical RGB/BGR sub-pixel displays         (like PDA screens, rotated LCD displays, etc.).

"Delay","I am the main way that a process may pause for some amount of time.  The simplest usage is like this:	(Delay forSeconds: 5) wait.An instance of Delay responds to the message 'wait' by suspending the caller's process for a certain amount of time. The duration of the pause is specified when the Delay is created with the message forMilliseconds: or forSeconds:. A Delay can be used again when the current wait has finished. For example, a clock process might repeatedly wait on a one-second Delay.The maximum delay is (SmallInteger maxVal // 2) milliseconds, or about six days. A delay in progress when an image snapshot is saved is resumed when the snapshot is re-started. Delays work across millisecond clock roll-overs.For a more complex example, see  #testDelayOf:for:rect: .A word of advice:This is THE highest priority code which is run in Pharo, in other words it is time-critical. The speed of this code is critical for accurate responses, it is critical for network services, it affects every last part of the system.In short: Don't fix it if it ain't broken! This code isn't supposed to be beautiful, it's supposed to be fast! The reason for duplicating code is to make it fast. The reason for not using ifNil:[]ifNotNil:[] is that the compiler may not inline those.

"LinkedList","A LinkedList is a sequential collection of objects where adjecent objects are linked by pointer. Using the message sequence addFirst:/removeLast causes the receiver to behave as a stack; using addLast:/removeFirst causes the receiver to behave as a queue.A LinkedList can be used to hold two different kinds of objecs:   (a) Objects inheriting frm Link  (b) Any objects.If you attempt to add any object into a LinkedList that is not a Link, it will automatically be wrapped by a ValueLink. A LinkedList therefore behaves very much like any collection, except that certain calls such as atIndex: are linear rather than constant time."

The reference-remembering mechanism would probably do bad things if you tried to read and write from the same ReferenceStream.[TBD] Should we override ""close"" to do (self forgetReferences)?Instance variables references -- an IdentityDictionary mapping objects already written	to their byteStream positions. If asked to write any object a	second time, we just write a reference to its stream position.	This handles shared objects and reference cycles between objects.	To implement ""weak references"" (for Aliases), the references	dictionary also maps objects not (yet?) written to a Collection	of byteStream positions with hopeful weak-references to it. If	asked to definitely write one of these objects, we'll fixup those	weak references. objects -- an IdentityDictionary mapping relative byte stream positions to	objects already read in. If asked to follow a reference, we	return the object already read.	This handles shared objects and reference cycles between objects. currentReference -- the current reference position. Positon relative to the 	start of object data in this file.  (Allows user to cut and paste smalltalk 	code from the front of the file without effecting the reference values.)  	This variable is used to help install each new object in ""objects"" as soon	as it's created, **before** we start reading its contents, in	case any of its content objects reference it. fwdRefEnds -- A weak reference can be a forward reference, which	requires advance-reading the referrent.

"SmartRefStream","Ordinary ReferenceStreams assume that the names and order of instance variables is exactly the same when an object file is written and read.  	SmartRefStream allows object files to be read even after instance variables have changed or the entire class has been renamed.When an object file is written, no one knows how the classes will change in the future.  Therefore, all conversion must be done when the file is read.  The key is to store enough information in the file about the names of the instance variables of all outgoing classes.  SmartRefStream works best with only one tree of objects per file.  You can nextPut: more than once, but each object tree gets its own class structure description, which is big.  Conversion of old objects is done by a method in each class called (convertToCurrentVersion: varDict refStream: smartRefStrm).  At fileOut time,  ChangeSet>>checkForConversionMethods creates a prototype of this method (if Preference #conversionMethodsAtFileOut is true).  The programmer must edit this method to (1) test if the incoming object needs conversion, (2) put non-nil values into any new inst vars that need them, and (3) save the data of any inst vars that are being deleted. Determining which old version is represented by the incoming object can be done in several ways: noticing that a current inst var is nil when it should have data, noticing that there is an older inst var name in the variable dictionary (varDict), checking kinds of objects in one or more inst vars, or retrieving the classVersion of the incoming object from the ref stream.  If a class is renamed, a method goes into SmartRefStream telling the new name.  The conversion method of the new class must be prepared to accept instances of the old class also.  If no inst var names have changed, the conversion method does nothing.An example:  	Suppose we change the representation of class Rectangle from ('origin' 'corner') to ('origin' 'extent').  Suppose lots of Rectangle instances are already out on files.  	The programmer changes the class definition, modifies all the methods, and filesOut.  A series of dialogs appear, asking if instances Rectangle might be in an object file, if 'extent' needs to be non-nil (yes), and if the info in 'corner' needs to be preserved (yes).  This method appears:Rectangle >> convertToCurrentVersion: varDict refStream: smartRefStrm	""These variables are automatically stored into the new instance: #('origin').	Test for this particular conversion.  Get values using expressions like (varDict at: 'foo').""	""New variables: #('extent').  If a non-nil value is needed, please assign it.""	""These are going away #('corner').  Possibly store their info in some other variable?""	""Move your code above the ^ super...  Delete extra comments.""	^ super convertToCurrentVersion: varDict refStream: smartRefStrmThe programmer modifies it to be:Rectangle >> convertToCurrentVersion: varDict refStream: smartRefStrm(varDict includesKey: 'extent') ifFalse: [""old version!""	""Create the new extent, and preserve the info from the old corner""	extent := (varDict at: 'corner') - origin.	].^ super convertToCurrentVersion: varDict refStream: smartRefStrm	This conversion method stays in the system and is ready to convert the old format of Rectangle whenever one is encountered in an object file.  Note that the subclasses of Rectangle, (B3DViewport, CharacterBlock, and Quadrangle) do not need conversion methods.  Their instances will be converted by the code in Rectangle.  	Files written by SmartRefStream are in standard fileout format.  You can mix raw objects with code to be filed in.  The file starts out in the normal fileOut format.  Definitions of new classes on the front.structures 	Dictionary of (#Rectangle -> #(<classVersionInteger> 'origin' 'corner')).

All class definitions are filed in.  A class may be stored inside an ImageSegment that itself is stored in a SmartRefStream.There is a separate subclass for doing veryDeepCopy (in memory).  Currently, any object for which objectToStoreOnDataStream return an object other than self, does this:  The new object (a DiskProxy) is traced.  When it comes time to go through the fields of the old object, they are not found as keys in references (DiskProxies are there instead).  So the old field value is left in the new object.  That is OK for StrikeFont, Class, MetaClass, DisplayScreen.  But the DiskProxies are evaluated, which takes a lot of time.Some metaclasses are put into the structures table.  This is for when a block has a receiver that is a class.  See checkFatalReshape:.ImageSegments:	A ReferenceStream is used to enumerate objects to put inside an ImageSegment.  If an instance of a UniClass is seen, the class is put in also.	A SmartRefStream is used to store the ImageSegment.  Roots are nil, and the segment is a wordArray.  We are encoding the outPointers.  Structures contains all classes from both places.    Do not write any class inst vars in file.--Ted Kaehler and Bob Arning."

"MorphTreeMorph","A MorphTreeMorph is a list and a tree in one easily customizable widget. A list or tree is made of nodes. Each node can be made of whatever object . This allows the use of morphs inside the tree. A MorphTreeMorph works with a model which must use the TMorphTreeModel trait. MorphTreeModel uses it and can serves  as the model or as a superclass for a specific tree model.Customizable columns:Several customizable columns can be viewed. Columns are separated by resizers used in order to increase or decrease the columns width with the mouse.A MorphTreeMorph can have a top header composed of buttons, one button per column. Such a button can have an icon and/or a title and may run some action when clicked on (a typical action is the ordering of the list). You can also allow column drag-and-drop so that a column  can be dynamically moved with a simple drop.See this in action with following example:-----------ClassListExample new openOn: Collection-----------By default, the last column is not bounded, so that no resizer is added for it and threre exists no unused space between the last scroller and the right side of the whole tree. But, in some case one want to have a resizer also for the last column. This is the case for data grid as an example This is possible by sending #makeLastColumnBounded to the MorphTreeMorph.Try it with:-----------SimpleGridExample new open-----------Single and multi-selection:A MorphTreeMorph implements single and multiple selection. Multi-selection is allowed by sending  #multiSelection: with true as argument. Several items can be selected with ctrl-click (or cmd-click on mac) or with shift-click (see MorphTreeMorphModel comments to see how to handle selection from the model).Try multi-selection with following example:------------SimplestClassListExample new openOn: Collection------------Double-click handling:You can allow double-click just by indicating the message to send to the model with the doubleClickSelector: selector.Try this with the package-tree example where double-clicking on a class node or or a method node open a browser on the class or on the method:------------PackageTreeExample new open------------Long list handling:For very long lists or trees, two kind of pager can be used to limit the number of items visible in the list. The idea  is that when you have very long lists, you most of the time do not  want to see all details but just want some visual support for what is in the list: - with a simple pager, you indicate how much items are to be seen in one page, the list items are viewed page by page,- with a chunk pager you can expand either incrementally or  all-together the number of items once you get to the bottom of the existing items.See SimplestClassListWithPagerExample and SimplestClassListWithChunkExample examples.Try them with:------------SimplestClassListWithPagerExample new openOn: Object.SimplestClassListWithChunkExample new openOn: Object.------------Columns/rows coloring:MorphTreeMorph makes it possible the coloring of either the columns or the rows. A MorphTreeMorph understands #rowColorForEven:odd: for rows coloring and columnColorForEven:odd: for columns coloring with two colors passed as argument (nil means no color). See following examples:-------------PackageTreeExample new open. ""For row coloring""ClassListExample new openOn: Collection. ""For column coloring""-------------Column drag and dropA column can be dragged.

When any one of several paths of control can be advanced, the single instance of ProcessorScheduler named Processor determines which one will actually be advanced partly using the value of priority.(If anyone ever makes a subclass of Process, be sure to use allSubInstances in anyProcessesAbove:.)Process-specific storage: 	An old implementation using #environmentAt: [ifAbsent:/put:] protocol are no longer supported.	One must not use a process-specific storage (PSS) methods directly, and instead use ProcessSpecificVariable (or subclass) instances to access process-specific storage.	A new implemention is a revision towards making an access to PSS faster.When new instance of ProcessSpecificVariable are created, it obtains an unique index, which is registered using #allocatePSKey: (see class side).This allows to dynamically create as many process-specific variables as needed, and access them in fast manner via simple array index (instead of dictionary lookup,as in previous implementation).Another important aspect of new implementation is that all values in PSS are held weakly. This is done to prevent accidental memory leaksas well as no need to manually unregistering a process-specific keys , once they are no longer in use."

"Object","Object is the root class for almost all of the other classes in the class hierarchy. The exceptions are ProtoObject (the superclass of Object) and its subclasses.Class Object provides default behavior common to all normal objects, such as access, copying, comparison, error handling, message sending, and reflection. Also utility messages that all objects should respond to are defined here.Object has no instance variables, nor should any be added. This is due to several classes of objects that inherit from Object that have special implementations (SmallInteger and UndefinedObject for example) or the VM knows about and depends on the structure and layout of certain standard classes.Class Variables:	DependentsFields		an IdentityDictionary		Provides a virtual 'dependents' field so that any object may have one		or more dependent views, synchronized by the changed:/update: protocol.		Note that class Model has a real slot for its dependents, and overrides		the associated protocol with more efficient implementations.	EventsFields			an IdentityDictionary that maps each object to its dependents.		Registers a message send (consisting of a selector and a receiver object)		which should be performed when anEventSymbol is triggered by the receiver.		Part of a new event notification framework which could eventually replace		the existing changed/update mechanism.  It is intended to be compatible		with Dolphin Smalltalk and VSE as much as possible.Because Object is the root of the inheritance tree, methods are often defined in Object to give all objects special behaviors needed by certain subsystems or applications, or to respond to certain general test messages such as isMorph.About at: index accepting float and not only integers This behavior is also free in the sense that the failure code is only invoked when theprimitive fails and so adds nothing to the cost of successful accesses,which are the high dynamic frequency operation.  It will also show up underprofiling if one is concerned about efficiency, and so isn't a hidden cost.It is also in keeping with Smalltalk's mixed mode/arbitrary precisionimplicit coercion number system that one *can* use fractions or floats asindices.  Stripping out coercions like this will make the system more brittle.  So please do *not* remove this ""hack"".  I think it's a feature and a useful  one.Can you give me an example that demonstrates the usefulness of thisfeature?| a r |a := Array new: 10 withAll: 0.r := Random new.100 timesRepeat: [| v | v := r next * 10 + 1. a at: v put: (a at: v) + 1].ai.e. I didn't have to provide an explicit rounding step.  That's useful.  But in general anywhere where an index is derived by some calculation not having to provide the rounding step could be useful/helpful/more concise.  e.g. (n roundTo: 0.1) * 10 vs ((n roundTo: 0.1) * 10) asInteger.Some thought went into the original choice.  It is not a hack but there by intent.  The integers are simply a subset of the reals and forcing the programmer to use them is favouring the machine above the programmer.But I think you should justify getting rid of it rather than my having to justify keeping it.  Getting rid of it risks breaking code.  If it is there but does not harm then why get rid of it?best Eliot Miranda "

"SettingDeclaration","A SettingDeclaration is an handler for a writtable setting value. Its main responsibility is allow real value changing and to hold descriptive data about the setting. When the real value is changed, all declared listeners are notified. The standard event mechanism is used for that purpose. See #value: method which is call in order to change a setting value. Whatever object can declare its interest in the real value changes by sending #whenChangedSend:to: to a setting. See notification protocol.For convenience, my olds values are registered in a list. This list is used by the SystemSettingBrowser in order to easily retrieve previous values.The type instance variable is a Symbol. It is used by the SystemSettingBrowser in order to build the input widget of a setting.It can be the name of the class or the name of a superclass of the value. In that case, the input widget is built by #settingInputWidgetForNode: implemented by the class which name is the value of the type instance variable. As an example, the input widget for a Boolean is built by Boolean class>>settingInputWidgetForNode:.Type value is not limited to be a class name. It can also be whatever symbol. In that case, the selector corresponding to the message to send to the setting in order to build the inputWidget is built by SettingDeclaration>>localInputWidgetSelector.

"FileUrl","This class models a file URL according to (somewhat) RFC1738, see http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1738.txtHere is the relevant part of the RFC:3.10 FILES   The file URL scheme is used to designate files accessible on a   particular host computer. This scheme, unlike most other URL schemes,   does not designate a resource that is universally accessible over the   Internet.   A file URL takes the form:       file://<host>/<path>   where <host> is the fully qualified domain name of the system on   which the <path> is accessible, and <path> is a hierarchical   directory path of the form <directory>/<directory>/.../<name>.   For example, a VMS file     DISK$USER:[MY.NOTES]NOTE123456.TXT   might become     <URL:file://vms.host.edu/disk$user/my/notes/note12345.txt>   As a special case, <host> can be the string ""localhost"" or the empty   string; this is interpreted as `the machine from which the URL is   being interpreted'.   The file URL scheme is unusual in that it does not specify an   Internet protocol or access method for such files; as such, its   utility in network protocols between hosts is limited.From the above we can conclude that the RFC says that the <path> part never starts or ends with a slash and is always absolute. If the last name can be a directory instead of a file is not specified clearly.The path is stored as a SequenceableCollection of path parts.Notes regarding non RFC features in this class:- If the last path part is the empty string, then the FileUrl is referring to a directory. This is also shown with a trailing slash when converted to a String.- The FileUrl has an attribute isAbsolute which signals if the path should be considered absolute or relative to the current directory. This distinction is not visible in the String representation of FileUrl, since the RFC does not have that.- Fragment is supported (kept for historical reasons)"

By convention, it must be the diagonal:	from rectangle origin (the point having smallest coordinates in reference frame),	to rectangle corner (the point having largest coordinates in reference frame).Note 3: Screen coordinates conventions are:	x is horizontal axis, zero at left border, oriented toward right;	y is vertical axis, zero at top border, oriented toward bottom.This corresponds to the latin convention for writing text from left to right and top to bottom.Note 4: the Rectangle extent is obtained by subtracting rectangle origin to rectangle corner coordinates.If this leads to a negative width (extent x coordinate) and/or a negative height (extent y coordinate), then the Rectangle is degenerated and considered empty.Instance variables:	origin	<Point> the coordinates of corner having smallest coordinates (top left in Screen coordinates)	corner	<Point> the coordinates of corner having largest coordinates (bottom right in Screen coordinates)"

All arithmetic in the hash computation must be done modulo 2^32. This implementation uses ThirtyTwoBitRegister objects to simulate hardware registers; this implementation is about six times faster than using LargePositiveIntegers (measured on a Macintosh G3 Powerbook).

The life cycle goes as follows:1. Initialization. Accepts a syntax tree (presumably produced by RxParser) and compiles it into a matcher built of other classes in this category.2. Matching. Accepts a stream or a string and returns a boolean indicating whether the whole stream or its prefix -- depending on the message sent -- matches the regex.3. Subexpression query. After a successful match, and before any other match, the matcher may be queried about the range of specific stream (string) positions that matched to certain parenthesized subexpressions of the original expression.Any number of queries may follow a successful match, and any number or matches may follow a successful initialization.Note that `matcher' is actually a sort of a misnomer. The actual matcher is a web of Rxm* instances built by RxMatcher during initialization. RxMatcher is just the interface facade of this network.  It is also a builder of it, and also provides a stream-like protocol to easily access the stream being matched.Instance variables:	matcher				<RxmLink> The entry point into the actual matcher.	stream				<Stream> The stream currently being matched against.	markerPositions		<Array of: Integer> Positions of markers' matches.	markerCount		<Integer> Number of markers.	lastResult 			<Boolean> Whether the latest match attempt succeeded or not.	lastChar			<Character | nil> character last seen in the matcher stream"

"TestResource","Normally a test will set up all the objects it needs and tear them down again after it has run.  This self-containedness makes a test more robust.  Use TestResources only for objects that are needed by several tests and that are too 'expensive' (in time or otherwise) to recreate and destroy for each test.  A viable approach is to develop the code in MyTestCase's #setUp and #tearDown methods, then at some point refactor the code into the #setUp and #tearDown of a TestResource whose class is added to MyTestCase class>>resource method.TestResource uses the singleton pattern.  A TestResource class will set up a single instance of itself when first requested and tear it down again at the end of TestSuite>>run (or TestCase>>run, >>debug and >>debugAsFailure).  Normally, a TestResource, once setUp, remains active during the running of all remaining tests and is #reset after all tests have run.  For an exception, see subclass CompetingResource in SUnitResourcePatterns.  Users can choose to #reset a resource in the #tearDown of a test that alters it, sacrificing the performance gain of having a single #setUp of the resource for the certainty that other tests using it will not see the alterations.  Generally however, this should be the exception:  if you need to reset the resource for every test that uses it, its code should just be part of your test's #setUp and #tearDown code.To use, create a subclass of TestResource and override the following:	- TestCase class>>resources, to return a collection including the TestResource class, for all test case classes that need it		* a TestCase' resources are set up in the order returned and torn down in the reverse order	- TestResource class>>resources, if the resource itself always needs some other resource to be present before it can set up		* a TestResource's resource are set up before it and torn down after it, and are set up in the order returned and torn down in the reverse order	- TestResource>>setUp and tearDown, to define initial and final behaviour (just like a test)	- TestResource>>isAvailable, to return true if it is and false if it isn't (the framework calls this after setUp);  ideally, this call should not change the resource' state - that should be done in setUpTestResource implements the singleton pattern in its class-side #isAvailable and #reset methods.  Do not override these when creating specific resources;  unless you are developing a whole new pattern of use, it will always be correct to override instance-side #setUp, #tearDown and #isAvailable, and dangerous to override class>>isAvailable, class>>isAlreadyAvailable and class>>reset.Generally, users do not code interactions with a test's resources during the running of a test.  Code that reads a resource' values while leaving its state strictly alone is safe enough.  A test must leave a resource in a clean state:  always use #reset if a test must protect later-running tests from unsafe changes (and review whether in such a case a resource is the right thing to use in the first place).See my superclass' comment for assertion and logging information."

Start up a recent and clean image	ScriptLoader new prepareNewUpdate		This step will 		- load the latest updates		- load the latest ScriptLoader package from the Pharo repository.		Indeed when we work on improving the ScriptLoader it may not be published in the update stream. 		New versions can be available on the server but not part of the latest updates.		Therefore the process always loads the latest version of scriptloader from the pharo repository.		This point is important because when an integration failed, you have to check and optionally 		remove the scriptloader package from the pharo repository.				- check that the update.list (which contains the cs to load the packages) is in sync		with the image current version. You have to download the latest version using a script like this one.		Pay attention to update it so that it reflects the right version (ie 1.0, 1.1, 1.2...)		     scp -p LOGIN@scm.gforge.inria.fr:/home/groups/pharo/htdocs/updates/pharo1.1/updates.list .		- snapshot the package version to detect dirty or changed but non dirty packages.2.) Apply changes	ScriptLoader new doneApplyingChanges		This step will 		- create an update method with can trigger the load of the packages and some pre/post actions		- create a script method with describes all the package versions and it used by the update methods		- save all the packages that are different (except some filtered packages)			into a local folder named package-to-be-tested.		ScriptLoader, SLICE*.... and a couple of other packages are not considered to be included in the script method			(check method packagesNotToSavePatternNames)		3.) Verify changes	==> in a ***new*** image (in the current folder) execute:	ScriptLoader new verifyNewUpdate	This step will 		- load in any order (so may break) the package previously saved		in the packages to be tested.		- this step is important because you may get simple changes with unexpected side effects and that 		may break the load.		4.) If there are problems go to 2.) to fix them, else:	ScriptLoader new publishChanges	This step will		- generate a new cs file whose purpose is to load the given version of the scriptloader and trigger the 		correct update method.		- add the name of the cs file to the end of the updates.list file local to the disc		- copy all the package from the local directory to the Pharo			After the updates.list and the cs file should be manually uploaded to the ftp (see below) 	   scp ""$1"" LOGIN@scm.gforge.inria.fr:/home/groups/pharo/htdocs/updates/pharo1.1/	5) in case of problems.Think that if you pass the step 4 you may have a scriptLoader version that got published and that is reloaded during the first step.CurrentMajorVersionNumber should contains a string '1.0', '1.1'....This string will determine on which folder on the server the updates.list should be loaded.	i.e., updates/pharo1.0, updates/pharo1.1 ....--- Not to forget ---To change the release streamadd a new method for each releaseStream	ScriptLoader toPharoOne	ScriptLoader toPharoOneDotOne"

"ThirtyTwoBitRegister","I represent a 32-bit register. An instance of me can hold any non-negative integer in the range [0..(2^32 - 1)]. Operations are performed on my contents in place, like a hardware register, and results are always modulo 2^32.This class is primarily meant for use by the SecureHashAlgorithm class."
"TaskbarMorph","Themed synchronous taskbar (not using #step to poll windows). The buttons provide visual feedback as to whether a window is active or minimised (collapsed) plus a popup menu with options to restore, minimise, maximise and close the associated window. Optional (via settings) preview of the window while mouse is over a taskbar button."

"InputEventSensor","An InputEventSensor is a replacement for the old Morphic EventSensor framework.It updates its state when events are received so that all state based users of Sensor (e.g., Sensor keyboard, Sensor leftShiftDown, Sensor mouseButtons) will work exactly as before. The usage of these funtions is discouraged. Instance variables:	mouseButtons <Integer>	- mouse button state as replacement for primMouseButtons	mousePosition <Point>	- mouse position as replacement for primMousePt	eventQueue <SharedQueue>	- an optional event queue for event driven applications	modifiers		<Integer>	- modifier statesClass variables:	ButtonDecodeTable	KeyDecodeTable"

"SystemAnnouncer","This class plays the role of the announcer for events raised by the Pharo system.Currently, it acts as a wrapper over the SystemChangeNotifier, but in the future it should be used for announcing the events directly from the system."
"Authorizer","The Authorizer does user authorization checking. Each instance of authorizer keeps track of the realm that it is authorizing for, and the table of authorized users. An authorizer can be asked to return the user name/symbol associated with a userID (which concatenates the username and password from the HTTP request) with the user: method."
"LimitingLineStreamWrapper","I'm a wrapper for a stream optimized for line-by-line access using #nextLine. My instances can be nested.I read one line ahead. Reading terminates when the stream ends, or if the limitingBlock evaluated with the line answers true. To skip the delimiting line for further reading use #skipThisLine.Character-based reading (#next) is permitted, too. Send #updatePosition when switching from line-based reading.See examples at the class side.--bf 2/19/1999 12:52"

"Announcer","The code is based on the announcements as described by Vassili Bykov in <http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/vbykov/blogView?searchCategory=Announcements%20Framework>. The implementation uses a threadsafe subscription registry, in the sense that registering, unregistering, and announcing from an announcer at the same time in different threads should never cause failures.For security reasons, registry is kept private, and has no accessor like in other implementations"
"EditingState","I store the current state of an editing session. An instance of mine is shared by all TextEditor instances that are created during an editing session managed by a TextMorph (see below for more explanations about editing session). The state data are basically made of an undo/redo manager and of all data needed in order to manage text editing undo and redo (mainly all informations for the current and previous selection intervals).I'm created by a TextEditor at the beginning of an editing session (see TextEditor>>editingStateClass and TextEditor>>editingState). Specializations can be introduced to fit a particular TextEditor subclass need.Editing session:An  editing session starts when a TextMorph is created (precisely, when a TextEditor instance is first assigned to a TextMorph editor instance variable). An editing session ends when a TextMorph is deleted. During an editing session, a TextMorph can make use of a lot of TextEditor instances, one at a time. As an example, each time a TextMorph is resized, its editor is released and a new one that fit the TextMorph physical properties  is created. Another example, when a TextMorph loses the keyboard focus, then its editor could be fully released; it is created again when the TextMorph retrieves the focus.When an editor is created by a TextMorph, the state of the previous TextEditor, stored in its associated EditingState instance, is got and passed to the newly created editor. Thus the editing session remains stable (see TextEditor >> #stateArray and TextMorph >> #installEditorToReplace:). So TextEditor instances are extremely volatile whereas its associated EditingState instance remains during the whole editing session.Instance Variables:   emphasisHere <Array of TextAttribute>   pointBlock <CharacterBlock>   markBlock <CharacterBlock>   startOfTyping <Integer>   previousInterval <Interval>   previousSelection <Text>   undoManager <HistoryIterator>   lastParenLocation <Integer>   mouseDownInterval <Interval>   secondarySelectionToken  ** obsolete ** should be removed **- emphasisHere:   The TextAttributes that are used for the newly entered text- pointBlock:   The CharacterBlock where a selection begins (where the mouse has first pointed)- markBlock:   The CharacterBlock where a selection ends- startOfTyping:   The index of the first character which has been entered during the currently undoable/redoable portion of text (see TextEditor>>#openTypeIn and TextEditor>>#doneTyping)- previousInterval:   Previous interval used for undo/redo actions- previousSelection:   The previously selected text for undo/redo actions- undoManager:   The undo/redo manager- lastParenLocation:   Keep the position of the open parenthesis which corresponds to the last entered close parenthesis- mouseDownInterval:   The position of the first mouse down in the editor"

"TextAndTextStreamTest","At May 09, 2003 Tim Olson sent a bug report to the Squeak developers list that inspired me to examine the protocol of TextStream in greater detail.  (The bug that Tim reported was present in Squeak 3.4, it is shown in testExample1.) In a discussion that followed,  Daniel Vainsencher proposed that we should have tests for Text and TextStreams. This class is an attempt to implement that proposal. For Squeak 3.4, some of the test examples fail."
